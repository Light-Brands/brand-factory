## 1. Albania (Saranda or Vlora) — The Cheat Code

**Why it's magic:** Stunning Ionian coastline, incredible food, almost absurdly cheap. Albania is the hidden gem of the Mediterranean right now — gorgeous beaches, Greek-island-level scenery at a fraction of the price. Saranda faces Corfu and has crystal-clear water.

| Category | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Villa/apartment (2 weeks) | ~$800–$1,500 total for a 4-5 bedroom place |
| Meals out | $5–10 per person |
| Coffee | $0.50–$1 |
| Internet | Solid in Saranda/Vlora, coworking spaces available |
| Flights from Cyprus | ~$100–200 roundtrip (via Athens or direct charters) |
| Visa | Americans and EU citizens visa-free for up to a year |
| **Est. 2-week total (6 people)** | **$3,000–$5,000 all-in** |

**Vibe:** Beach town meets Balkan charm. Fresh seafood, hilltop castles, day trips to Ksamil (the "Albanian Maldives") and Blue Eye spring.

## 2. Antalya Region, Turkey — The All-Rounder

**Why it's magic:** World-class infrastructure, insane food scene, the Turkish lira makes everything dirt cheap for foreign currency holders. Kas or Kalkan for boutique vibes, or Antalya proper for city energy.

| Category | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Villa with pool (2 weeks) | ~$1,200–$2,500 for a 4-5 bedroom villa with private pool |
| Meals out | $5–12 per person |
| Internet | Excellent — Turkey has great digital infrastructure |
| Flights from Cyprus | ~$50–150 roundtrip (1hr hop) |
| Visa | Most nationalities get e-visa easily |
| **Est. 2-week total (6 people)** | **$4,000–$7,000 all-in** |

**Vibe:** Ancient ruins, turquoise coast, hammams, bazaars, incredible kebabs. Kas specifically is a small coastal town perfect for focused work + evening harbor dinners.

## 3. Crete, Greece — The Classic

**Why it's magic:** The largest Greek island with enormous variety — beaches, mountains, gorges, ancient history. More affordable than Santorini/Mykonos by a huge margin. Chania's old Venetian harbor is stunning.

| Category | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Villa with pool (2 weeks) | ~$2,000–$4,000 (shoulder season much cheaper) |
| Meals out | $10–18 per person |
| Internet | Good in towns, variable in rural areas |
| Flights from Cyprus | ~$80–200 roundtrip |
| **Est. 2-week total (6 people)** | **$5,000–$9,000 all-in** |

**Vibe:** Olive groves, raki with every meal, Samaria Gorge hikes, pink-sand Elafonissi beach. Best food in Greece, arguably.

## 4. Montenegro (Kotor / Budva) — The Dramatic One

**Why it's magic:** Kotor Bay looks like a Norwegian fjord dropped into the Mediterranean. UNESCO old town, dramatic mountains plunging into the sea. Still very affordable.

| Category | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Villa (2 weeks) | ~$1,500–$3,000 for a large stone villa or apartment |
| Meals out | $8–15 per person |
| Internet | Decent in coastal towns |
| Flights from Cyprus | ~$150–300 roundtrip (usually via Athens/Istanbul) |
| **Est. 2-week total (6 people)** | **$4,500–$7,500 all-in** |

**Vibe:** Medieval walled cities, kayaking the bay, hiking Lovcen mountain, day trips to Dubrovnik. Most dramatic scenery on this list.

## 5. Northern Cyprus — The Easy Win

**Why it's magic:** The team already knows Cyprus, but the north uses Turkish lira so everything is 60-70% cheaper than the south. Zero travel friction.

| Category | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Villa (2 weeks) | ~$800–$1,800 |
| Meals out | $5–8 per person |
| Internet | Decent |
| Flights | None — just drive across |
| **Est. 2-week total (6 people)** | **$2,500–$4,500 all-in** |

**Vibe:** Quiet beaches, Bellapais Abbey, Kyrenia harbor. The easy-mode option if the team wants a change of scenery without airport hassle.

## Recommendation

**Best bang-for-buck: Albania (Saranda/Ksamil).** A gorgeous 5-bedroom villa with sea views for under $1,500 for two weeks is realistic. The food is incredible. It genuinely feels like discovering somewhere before everyone else does.

**Best reliability and infrastructure: Antalya/Kas, Turkey.** Closest to Cyprus, cheapest flights, best internet, and the Turkish lira means your money goes incredibly far.

**Best time to go:** May–June or September–October for all destinations — perfect weather, lower prices, no peak-season crowds.
