# Phase 1: Agentic Foundation & Serial Mastery

**Timeline:** Q1 - Q2 2026

---

## Objective

Build and launch blockchain-sovereign businesses with light-focused software at a weekly cadence.

---

## Key Focus Areas

### 1. Weekly Serial Launches

Each business is a fully decentralized ecosystem:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Native Token | Custom tokenomics for each launch |
| On-Chain Governance | DAO structures from day one |
| DeFi Primitives | Staking, liquidity, yields |
| Sovereign Operations | No central dependencies |

### 2. Agent Swarm Architecture

Agent swarms include specialized crypto modules:

- **Token Designer** — Creates tokenomics models
- **Contract Deployer** — Deploys and verifies smart contracts
- **Liquidity Bootstrapper** — Initializes markets and pools
- **Governance Architect** — Sets up DAO frameworks
- **Brand Builder** — Visual identity and messaging
- **Market Launcher** — Go-to-market execution

### 3. Software Outputs

All software serves sovereignty and brightness:

- Wallet integration tools
- DAO governance frameworks
- Decentralized identity systems
- Privacy-preserving solutions
- Financial sovereignty tools

## Intelligence Milestone

**End of Q2 2026:** Proto-AGI agents with embedded capabilities:

- Crypto reasoning (tokenomics, DeFi, governance)
- Light-focused alignment
- Multi-domain problem solving
- Autonomous business creation

## Launch Process

### Weekly Rhythm

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | Ideation & selection |
| Tuesday | Design & architecture |
| Wednesday | Development & contracts |
