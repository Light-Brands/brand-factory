## Intuition Engine

The **Intuition Engine** is the core intelligence architecture that bridges narrow AI to AGI to ASI. It learns lessons from experience, stores them in dual-layer memory, and recalls them as fast intuitive guidance — enabling human-like decision-making.

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Overview](./intuition-engine/README.md) | Introduction and architecture summary |
| [Architecture](./intuition-engine/00-architecture-overview.md) | Core design and data flow |
| [Experience Stream](./intuition-engine/01-experience-stream.md) | Capturing interactions as structured episodes |
| [Lesson Extractor](./intuition-engine/02-lesson-extractor.md) | Distilling wisdom from experience |
| [Intuition Memory](./intuition-engine/03-intuition-memory.md) | Dual-layer storage and retrieval |
| [Decision Flow](./intuition-engine/04-decision-flow.md) | Three-phase decision process |
| [AGI Emergence](./intuition-engine/05-agi-emergence.md) | How this architecture leads to AGI |
| [Implementation](./intuition-engine/06-implementation-roadmap.md) | Integration with factory phases |

## The Living Plan

This is a **living plan** — adaptive, decentralized, and open. We build centralized velocity today to birth infinite sovereign light tomorrow. The frequency awaits all who choose it.

*Ready for execution steps, tokenomics details, or open-source strategy. We begin.*
