# Anchor Partnership Playbook: Cho Ventures & Influex

## The Strategic Imperative

These two partnerships aren't just revenue—they're the **proof points** that unlock everything else. Done right, they become:

1. **Case studies** that close the next 20 deals
2. **Referral engines** that generate warm intros
3. **Methodology validators** that prove the 48-hour sprint works
4. **Platform testers** that help build your tools
5. **Content generators** that fuel your marketing engine

Done wrong, they become:
- Discounted work that sets bad precedents
- Over-serviced relationships that drain capacity
- Case studies you can't publish
- IP that walks out the door

YOU OWN: Layers 2-4 (Frameworks, Insights, Strategy)
THEY OWN: Layer 1 (their data) and Layer 5 (their outcomes)
SHARED: The application of your methodology to their context
```

### The IP Protection Principles

**Principle 1: Methodology Stays Yours**
- The *process* by which you arrive at insights = your IP
- The *frameworks* you use to analyze = your IP
- The *templates* you fill in = your IP (they get a completed copy)

**Principle 2: Their Context Stays Theirs**
- Their data, brand info, internal documents = their IP
- The final deliverable applied to them = shared (license to them)
- Their results from implementation = their IP

**Principle 3: Patterns Become Yours**
- Anonymized learnings from every engagement = your IP
- Case study with their permission = shared (you publish, they approve)
- Aggregate insights across clients = your IP (they never see)

## The Case Study Extraction Process

### Turning Every Engagement into Growth Fuel

```
DURING ENGAGEMENT:

Week 1:
□ Document initial state (before metrics, screenshots)
□ Record discovery call insights
□ Note client's exact words about problems

Week 2-3:
□ Track hours and AI usage
□ Document methodology application
□ Capture key decision points

Delivery:
□ Record client reaction
□ Get initial testimonial quote
□ Schedule 30-day follow-up


POST-ENGAGEMENT (30-60 Days):

Follow-up Call:
□ What have you implemented?
□ What results have you seen?
□ What would you tell others considering this?
□ Can we use your name and company?

Documentation:
□ Write case study draft
□ Include before/after
□ Quantify results where possible
□ Get client approval

Distribution:
□ Website case study page
□ LinkedIn post series
□ Newsletter feature
□ Podcast mention
□ Sales collateral
```

### Case Study Template

```markdown
# [Client Name]: [Headline Result]

## The Challenge
[2-3 sentences on what they were facing]

## The Approach
[Brief description of methodology applied]

## The Timeline
[48 hours / 1 week / etc.]

## The Results
- [Quantified result 1]
- [Quantified result 2]
- [Qualitative result]

## Client Quote
"[Direct quote from client]"
— [Name], [Title], [Company]

## Key Learnings
[1-2 insights that apply to others]
```

## Negotiation Playbook

### When They Push Back on Price

**"Can you do it for less?"**

Response framework:
1. Acknowledge the ask
2. Reframe around value, not cost
3. Offer alternatives, not discounts

Example:
> "I understand you're working within constraints. The charter rate of $40K is already 47% below our standard pricing, reflecting our investment in this partnership. Rather than reducing scope, let's discuss what success looks like—if this delivers what we expect, the ROI will be extraordinary. Would it help to adjust payment timing?"

### When They Want More Scope

**"Can you also include X?"**

Response framework:
1. Validate the need
2. Explain what's included and why
3. Offer scope as a separate engagement

Example:
> "Implementation support is crucial—you're right to think about it. Our sprint is designed to give you everything you need to implement independently. We've found that separating strategy from implementation actually produces better results. We can absolutely discuss an implementation advisory package as a follow-on."

### When They Want Exclusive Rights

**"We don't want you working with our competitors"**

Response framework:
1. Understand the concern
2. Explain your confidentiality standards
3. Offer limited exclusivity at premium

Example:
> "I completely understand the concern. We maintain strict confidentiality—nothing from your engagement would ever be shared with a competitor. We don't offer blanket exclusivity as it limits our ability to develop expertise, but we can discuss a limited non-compete window or a premium exclusive tier if that's important to you."

### When They Want to Own the IP

**"We want full ownership of everything you create"**

Response framework:
1. Explain the value exchange
2. Distinguish between deliverables and methodology
3. Offer work-for-hire pricing (3-5x standard)

Example:
> "The deliverables—your brand strategy, positioning, all recommendations—are yours to use forever. Our methodology and frameworks are what enable us to do this work efficiently and affordably. If you need full IP ownership including methodology, we offer a work-for-hire model at [$X], which reflects the full value of that intellectual property."

## Red Flags & Walk-Away Triggers

### When to Decline or Renegotiate

**Red Flag 1: No case study rights**
- If they won't allow any public reference, the charter discount doesn't make sense
- Walk away or charge full price

**Red Flag 2: Scope creep before signing**
- If they're expanding asks during negotiation, they'll do it during delivery
- Document scope meticulously or add buffer

**Red Flag 3: Payment terms beyond 30 days**
- Charter partners should pay quickly
- If they can't/won't, they're not treating this as priority

**Red Flag 4: Decision-maker not engaged**
- If you're negotiating with someone who needs approval, pause
- Get decision-maker in room before finalizing

**Red Flag 5: "Let's start with a test project"**
- Small tests often become discount expectations
- Either do the real engagement or decline

### Walk-Away Script

> "I appreciate the conversation, and I can see there's potential here. Based on what we've discussed, I don't think we're aligned on [price/scope/timeline/terms] in a way that would set us both up for success. I'd rather be honest about that now than disappoint you later. If circumstances change, I'd welcome another conversation."

## Summary: The Anchor Partner Philosophy

**They're not clients—they're partners.**

This means:
- You invest more upfront (discounted rates)
- You expect more back (case studies, referrals, relationships)
- You protect your core assets (methodology, IP, insights)
- You build for the long game (platform partnerships, ongoing revenue)

**The math must work:**
- Even at discounted rates, you should earn $750+/hour
- Every engagement should produce 3+ pieces of content
- Every partner should generate 3+ referrals in year one
- Every case study should help close 2+ similar deals

**What success looks like at month 6:**
- $276K collected from anchor partners
- 7+ case studies published
- 10+ warm referrals made
- 2+ platform partnership conversations
- Methodology validated and documented
- Content engine running on partner insights

This is how you turn two partnerships into a flywheel that funds your entire operation.
