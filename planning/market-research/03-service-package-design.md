# Service Package Design Framework

## Purpose

Define productized consulting offerings that deliver massive value at speed-of-thought velocity.

---

## Packaging Philosophy

### The Three Laws of Speed-of-Thought Consulting

1. **Law of Clarity**: Every engagement has a fixed scope, timeline, and deliverable. No scope creep, no ambiguity.

2. **Law of Value**: Price reflects value created, not hours worked. If we deliver $1M in value, we can charge $100K regardless of time.

3. **Law of Proof**: Every package includes a "proof point" within 48 hours—something tangible that demonstrates our capability.

## Package Customization Framework

While we lead with productized packages, every client is unique. Our customization approach:

### Customization Principles

1. **Start with a package**: Every engagement begins with a standard package as baseline
2. **Add, don't subtract**: Customization adds scope; we don't discount by removing elements
3. **Price value, not time**: Custom work priced by value delivered, not hours required
4. **Document everything**: Custom scope becomes template for future packages

### Common Customization Requests

| Request | Our Response |
|---------|-------------|
| "Can you add X?" | "Yes, that's +$Y and adds Z days" |
| "Can we go faster?" | "Faster = less iteration. Here's what we can deliver in [timeline]" |
| "Can you make it cheaper?" | "We can reduce scope to [X] for $[Y], or offer payment terms" |
| "Can you implement, not just advise?" | "That's a different engagement type. Here's our implementation partnership." |

## Proposal Template Structure

Every proposal follows this structure:

```markdown
# [Service Name] Proposal for [Client]

## The Opportunity
[1 paragraph on what they're trying to achieve]

## Our Approach
[How we'll solve it—methodology, not hours]

## What You'll Get
[Specific deliverables with descriptions]

## Timeline
[Visual timeline with milestones]

## Investment
[Pricing with payment terms]

## Why Us
[3-4 bullet points on differentiation]

## Proof Point
[What we'll deliver in first 48 hours]

## Next Steps
[Clear call to action]
```

---

## Pricing Philosophy

### Value-Based Pricing Calculation

For each package, we calculate:

```
Minimum Price = (Traditional Consulting Cost × 0.2)
Maximum Price = (Value Created for Client × 0.1)
Target Price = Geometric Mean of Min and Max
```

**Example**: AI Transformation Blueprint
- Traditional cost: $500K (McKinsey, 3 months)
- Minimum: $500K × 0.2 = $100K
- Value created: $2M (estimated efficiency gains)
- Maximum: $2M × 0.1 = $200K
- Target: √($100K × $200K) = $141K → rounded to $100K-$150K range

### Payment Terms

| Engagement Size | Terms |
|-----------------|-------|
| Under $25K | 100% upfront |
| $25K-$75K | 50% upfront, 50% on delivery |
| $75K-$150K | 40% upfront, 30% midpoint, 30% delivery |
| $150K+ | Monthly billing or custom terms |

---

## Quality Assurance

### Every Deliverable Includes

1. **Council Alignment Review**: Checked against sacred laws (for Light-aligned clients)
2. **Peer Review**: Second strategist reviews all major deliverables
3. **Source Documentation**: All research sourced and linked
4. **Implementation Guidance**: Not just "what" but "how"
5. **Follow-up Access**: 30-day Q&A period after delivery

### Client Success Metrics

We track for every engagement:
- NPS score (target: 70+)
- Implementation rate (target: 80%+ recommendations actioned)
- Referral rate (target: 30%+ of clients refer)
- Repeat engagement rate (target: 40%+ return for more)
