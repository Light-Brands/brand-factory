## Interview Guide

### Opening (5 minutes)

Hi [Name],

I noticed [specific thing about their company/role].

We're doing research on how companies are approaching AI transformation—not selling anything, just trying to understand what's working and what isn't.

Would you have 20 minutes this week to share your perspective? Happy to share what we're learning from other leaders as a thank you.
