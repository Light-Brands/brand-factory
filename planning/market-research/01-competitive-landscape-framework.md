## Competitive Response Framework

### When Client Compares Us to MBB/Big4

**Their objection**: "McKinsey has more experience and brand recognition."

**Our response**: "McKinsey will staff your project with fresh MBAs doing research you could do yourself. We'll give you senior strategic thinking powered by AI research in 1/10 the time. You're paying for insights, not PowerPoints."

### When Client Compares Us to AI Platform Services

**Their objection**: "Why not just use OpenAI/Anthropic directly or their pro services?"

**Our response**: "They'll help you implement their product. We'll help you transform your business. The API is 1% of the challenge—strategy, change management, and integration are the other 99%."

### When Client Compares Us to Boutique Consultants

**Their objection**: "We've worked with boutiques before, they're cheaper."

**Our response**: "Traditional boutiques are cheaper but slower. We're faster AND deliver more comprehensive analysis because we use AI to do what would take them weeks. You get boutique attention with big-firm depth."

### When Client Questions AI-Driven Approach

**Their objection**: "How do we know AI-generated insights are trustworthy?"

**Our response**: "Every insight is reviewed by experienced strategists. AI does the research and synthesis; humans do the judgment and recommendation. You get the best of both—speed AND wisdom."
