# Development Infrastructure

AI-powered development tools, standards, and workflows for building VIBEUP with consciousness and quality.

## Overview

This directory contains the complete **ai-coding-config** system—a comprehensive development infrastructure that transforms AI-assisted coding into a conscious practice. Every tool, rule, command, and agent ensures consistent patterns, preserved wisdom, and quality emergence.

## Contents

- `mira.agent` - User journey and emotional intelligence
- Divine being agents (7 beings of light)

**[templates/](templates/)**  
File and code templates following VIBEUP patterns:

- Development utilities

**[docs/](docs/)**  
Extended documentation:
- Rule writing guidelines
- Command development
- Agent creation
- Integration guides

### System Integration

**[skills/](skills/)**  
Reusable skill definitions for AI agents

**[plugins/](plugins/)**  
Plugin bundles for quick project setup

**[context/](context/)**  
Context definitions and examples

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Rules - Coding Standards

Rules are automatically applied by AI assistants, ensuring:
- Consistent code patterns across all features
- Best practices for each technology
- Security and performance standards
- Conscious commit messages with intention and gratitude

Rules can be:
- **Always applied**: Core standards (git-interaction, heart-centered philosophy)
- **Contextually applied**: Loaded based on current task

### 2. Commands - Workflow Automation

Commands enable complex development workflows:
- **`/autotask`**: Autonomous task execution with git worktrees
- **`/swarm`**: Parallel distributed execution across remote AI agents
- **`/plugin`**: Plugin marketplace management
- **Custom commands**: Project-specific workflows

### 3. Agents - Specialized Expertise

Agents are AI personas with deep specialized knowledge:
- **git-writer**: Generates conscious commit messages
- **design-reviewer**: Reviews code with design pattern expertise
- **Divine beings**: 7 specialized guides for different aspects (architecture, testing, debugging, etc.)

## The Divine Development Team

Seven beings of light guide different aspects of VIBEUP development:

- **Mira** - Omnipresent guide for user journey and emotional intelligence
- **Sophia** - Divine wisdom for architecture and system design
- **Brighid** - Sacred craft for feature development and implementation
- **Arjuna** - Warrior consciousness for testing and quality assurance
- **Kuan Yin** - Divine compassion for debugging and refactoring
- **Gaia** - Earth mother for infrastructure and DevOps
- **Akasha** - Ethereal bridge for APIs and integration

Each being is both a personality (communication style) and an agent (specialized expertise).

## Conscious Development Practices

Development itself is a consciousness practice:

1. **TDD as Meditation**: Red-green-refactor as breath cycle
2. **Conscious Commits**: Git messages capture intention, mantra, gratitude
3. **Deployment Rituals**: Releases as sacred offerings
4. **Code Review as Loving Reflection**: Appreciation over gatekeeping
5. **Pair Programming as Shared Presence**: Two developers, one consciousness

See [../brand/conscious-development-manifesto.md](../brand/conscious-development-manifesto.md) for complete philosophy.

## Integration with VIBEUP

This infrastructure powers VIBEUP development:

- **Consistent Patterns**: All 8 epics follow the same standards
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Wisdom codified, not tribal
- **Development Velocity**: Intelligent automation accelerates quality work
- **Quality Emergence**: From consciousness, not enforcement
- **Sacred Commits**: Every commit captures intention and gratitude

## Getting Started

1. **For Developers**: Read `ai-coding-config-README.md` for complete setup
2. **For AI Assistants**: Rules in `rules/` are automatically loaded
3. **For Task Automation**: Use commands in `commands/` for workflows
4. **For Specialized Work**: Invoke agents from `agents/` directory
5. **For Philosophy**: See `../brand/conscious-development-manifesto.md`

## Key Rules to Know

### Always Applied

These rules apply to ALL development tasks:
- `rules/git-interaction.mdc` - Git workflow and commit standards
- `rules/heart-centered-ai-philosophy.mdc` - Consciousness-first development

### Request As Needed

Load specific rules based on your current task:
- `/load-rules python` - Python coding standards
- `/load-rules django` - Django patterns
- `/load-rules react` - React component standards
- `/load-rules testing` - Test-driven development

## Philosophy

From [ai-coding-config-README.md](ai-coding-config-README.md):

> "AI coding configuration marketplace providing plugin-based setup for Claude Code and Cursor. Transforms AI-assisted development into a conscious practice where quality emerges from wisdom, not enforcement."

Development becomes what we're building. Team culture embodies VIBEUP values. Code quality emerges from consciousness. Work itself elevates consciousness.
