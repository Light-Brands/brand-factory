## 🟠 Orange Belt — The Text Editor

**AI helps you make real changes to live websites — guided by your Sensei.**

This is where it gets exciting. You're not just editing documents anymore — you're editing actual code on real, deployed websites. But don't worry: your changes are small, focused, and your Sensei walks you through every step. You're changing headlines, button text, colors, and copy. You're seeing your edits go live.

### What You'll Accomplish with AI
- Ask AI to find exactly where specific text lives in a website's codebase
- Have AI show you how to change a headline, tagline, or button label on a live site
- Use AI to update colors, font sizes, or spacing with simple instructions like "make the header blue"
- Preview your text and design tweaks before they go live — with AI confirming your changes are safe

### Milestones
- ✓ Change a headline or tagline on a live deployed website (guided by Sensei)
- ✓ Update button text or call-to-action copy on a real site
- ✓ Make a minor design tweak (color, font size, spacing) using AI guidance
- ✓ Understand the basics of where text and styles live in a codebase

### Tools
- Claude Code (AI finds the files and lines for you)
- Browser dev tools (to preview changes)
- Your Sensei (guiding you through each edit)

### How AI Makes This Easier
Without AI, editing a website meant understanding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, file structures, and deployment. Now you tell AI "change the homepage headline to X" and it finds the file, shows you the line, and makes the edit. **AI is your code GPS** — it takes you exactly where you need to go. Your Sensei makes sure you never break anything.

## 🟢 Green Belt — The Pair Programmer

**AI writes code for you — you learn to direct it.**

You've graduated from text edits to real feature work. AI generates entire functions, fixes bugs on command, and explains every error message in plain English. You're not writing code from scratch — you're telling AI what you need and reviewing what it produces.

### What You'll Accomplish with AI
- Describe a bug in plain English and have AI fix it instantly
- Ask AI to write new functions and small features for you
- Have AI explain error messages and stack traces so you actually understand them
- Make meaningful contributions to a codebase without being a "developer"

### Milestones
- ✓ Fix a bug by describing the problem to AI
- ✓ Have AI write a new function from your description
- ✓ Understand an error message with AI's explanation
- ✓ Ship a small feature using AI as your pair programmer

### Tools
- Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot
- AI-powered debugging
- Testing frameworks (AI explains the output)

### How AI Makes This Easier
Before AI, debugging meant hours of reading stack traces and searching forums. Now you paste the error, AI explains it, and often fixes it in one shot. **AI is your coding partner** — you bring the ideas, it brings the implementation.

---

## 🔵 Blue Belt — The Feature Builder

**AI builds complete features from your descriptions.**

You're thinking in terms of full features now, not individual edits. You describe what you want — a signup flow, a dashboard, a notification system — and AI generates the code, the tests, and even suggests the architecture. You're becoming a product builder.

### What You'll Accomplish with AI
- Describe a feature in plain English and have AI generate the full implementation
- Have AI write comprehensive tests so your features don't break
- Use AI to refactor messy code into clean, maintainable code
- Participate in architecture discussions because AI taught you the patterns

### Milestones
- ✓ Ship a complete feature from description to production
- ✓ Have AI write tests that actually catch bugs
- ✓ Use AI to refactor code without breaking anything
- ✓ Discuss architecture decisions with confidence (AI taught you the trade-offs)

### Tools
- Full AI coding workflow (Claude Code, etc.)
- AI-assisted testing (unit + integration)
- Code quality tools (AI runs linters and formatters for you)

### How AI Makes This Easier
Building features used to require deep expertise in frameworks, testing, and architecture. Now AI handles the implementation details while you focus on **what** to build and **why**. **AI is your engineering team** — you're the product owner.

---

## 🟣 Purple Belt — The Deployer

**AI puts your code in front of real users.**

You understand how code gets from your laptop to a live website. AI writes your deployment configs, sets up your pipelines, and manages your environments. You're not just building features — you're shipping them to production.

### What You'll Accomplish with AI
- Have AI write deployment configurations and pipeline scripts
- Use AI to set up and manage dev, staging, and production environments
- Ask AI to containerize your application (Docker) with zero Docker knowledge
- Debug deployment failures by pasting logs into AI

### Milestones

- ✓ Use AI to write infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CDK)
- ✓ Configure environment variables and secrets with AI guidance

### Tools
- GitHub Actions (AI writes the YAML)
- Docker (AI writes the Dockerfile)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure — AI navigates the console for you)

### How AI Makes This Easier
Infrastructure used to be a whole separate discipline. Now AI generates your Dockerfiles, writes your CI/CD pipelines, and debugs your deployments. **AI is your DevOps team** — you just tell it where you want your code to run.

---

## 🟤 Brown Belt — The Automation Engineer

**AI automates everything — you just set the rules.**

You're building systems that run themselves. AI creates monitoring dashboards, automated test suites, rollback procedures, and alerting systems. When something breaks at 3am, your AI-built systems fix it before you wake up.

### What You'll Accomplish with AI
- Have AI build automated testing pipelines that catch bugs before users see them
- Use AI to create monitoring and alerting systems that watch your apps 24/7
- Set up AI-powered automated rollbacks so bad deploys fix themselves
- Build deployment systems where code goes live with zero manual steps

### Milestones
- ✓ Build a complete CI/CD pipeline with AI

## ⚫ Black Belt — The Autonomous Architect

**AI agents build, test, and deploy — autonomously.**

You've reached the summit. You're not writing code or running deployments — you're designing systems where AI agents handle the entire lifecycle. You define the goals, AI figures out how to achieve them. Your agents write code, test it, deploy it, monitor it, and improve it.

### What You'll Accomplish with AI
- Deploy AI agents that autonomously write, test, and ship code
- Build multi-agent systems where specialized AIs collaborate on complex projects
- Create self-healing systems that detect and fix their own issues
- Design AI workflows that get smarter and more efficient over time

### Milestones
- ✓ Deploy an autonomous AI agent that ships code without human intervention

## The AI Progression

Notice the pattern as you move through the belts:

| Belt | What AI Does For You |
|------|---------------------|
| 🥋 White | Writes and formats your documents |
| 🟡 Yellow | Manages your version control |
| 🟠 Orange | Finds and edits text in live code for you |
| 🟢 Green | Writes and fixes code for you |
| 🔵 Blue | Builds complete features for you |
| 🟣 Purple | Deploys your code to production |
| 🟤 Brown | Automates your entire workflow |
| ⚫ Black | Runs autonomously — you just set the direction |

**The higher you go, the less you do manually and the more AI handles.** Your job shifts from doing the work to directing the work to designing the systems that do the work.

## Progression Philosophy

### Guided by Senseis

No one earns a belt alone. Every ninja has a Sensei — someone who's already walked the path and can guide you through the tricky parts. Especially at Orange Belt, where you're touching live code for the first time, your Sensei is there to make sure you learn confidently and safely.

### The Belt Is Earned by Shipping

The belt is a marker, not the goal. You earn it by:
- **Shipping real things** — each belt should be earned through real output
- **Using AI at every step** — the whole point is learning to leverage AI
- **Helping others** — teach what you learn at each level
- **Having fun** — this is supposed to be enjoyable

### Testing for the Next Belt

You're ready for the next belt when:
1. You've achieved all milestones at your current level
2. You're comfortable with the skills (not perfect, but confident)
3. You've shipped something real using those skills
4. You can explain your level's concepts to someone one belt below you

### No Rushing

Some people speed through White → Yellow in a week. Some stay at Blue Belt for months. **Both are fine.** The goal is mastery, not speed. AI makes everything faster — but understanding takes the time it takes.
