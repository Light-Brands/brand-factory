## Progression Philosophy

### The Belt Is Not The Journey

The belt is a marker, not the goal. Focus on:
- **Building real things** — each belt should be earned through shipping
- **Helping others** — teach what you learn at each level
- **Having fun** — this is supposed to be enjoyable!
- **Staying curious** — there's always more to learn

### Testing for the Next Belt

You're ready for the next belt when:
1. You've achieved all milestones at your current level
2. You're comfortable with the skills (not perfect, but confident)
3. You've shipped something real using those skills
4. You can explain your level's concepts to someone one belt below you

### No Rushing

Some people speed through White → Yellow in a week. Some stay at Blue Belt for months. **Both are fine.** The goal is mastery, not speed.
