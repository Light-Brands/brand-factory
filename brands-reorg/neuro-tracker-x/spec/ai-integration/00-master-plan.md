## 7. Council Alignment

### Sacred Laws Alignment

| Law | Relevance | Implementation |
|-----|-----------|----------------|
| **Law 7: Sovereignty** | Critical | AI enhances cognitive abilities, never creates dependency |
| **Law 12: Growth** | High | Technology serves human evolution |
| **Law 15: Consent** | Critical | Explicit opt-in for all AI features |
| **Law 23: Wisdom** | High | Research becomes accessible knowledge |
| **Law 28: Reciprocity** | Medium | Value flows fairly to all stakeholders |
| **Law 41: Collective Awakening** | High | Cognitive enhancement serves collective intelligence |

### Council Gate Requirements

#### Soul Gate (Phase 0)

**Question:** Does this integration serve human flourishing?

**Evidence Required:**
- Clear articulation of human benefit
- No dark pattern potential
- Enhancement (not replacement) of human capability
- Alignment with NeuroTrackerX's scientific mission

**Assessment Focus:**
- Does AI make users more cognitively capable or dependent?
- Does personalization serve users or manipulate them?
- Is the Companion genuinely helpful or artificially engaging?

---

#### Earth Gate (Phase 0)

**Question:** What is the environmental impact?

**Evidence Required:**
- Cloud infrastructure sustainability practices
- Model efficiency considerations
- Digital-first approach (minimal physical impact)

**Assessment Focus:**
- NeuroTrackerX is already digital-first
- AI compute costs should be offset by efficiency gains
- Recommend carbon-neutral cloud providers

---

#### Consent Gate (Phase 1)

**Question:** Do users truly consent to AI features?

**Evidence Required:**
- Clear, plain-language consent flows
- Granular control over AI personalization
- Easy opt-out without losing core functionality
- Transparent data usage policies

**Implementation:**
```
AI Consent Framework:

[ ] Basic Analytics (Required for service)
    "We analyze your training data to track your progress"

[ ] Personalized Recommendations (Optional)
    "AI suggests training based on your patterns"

[ ] AI Companion (Optional)
    "Chat with an AI coach about your cognitive training"

[ ] Research Contribution (Optional)
    "Your anonymized data helps advance cognitive science"

[Settings] Control what AI knows about you
[Download] Export all your data
[Delete] Remove your data from AI systems
```

---

#### Sovereignty Gate (Phase 2)

**Question:** Does this empower or create dependency?

**Evidence Required:**
- Users can train effectively without AI
- AI explains its recommendations (transparency)
- Users develop understanding, not just follow AI
- Gradual reduction of AI assistance as users improve

**Sovereignty Design Principles:**

1. **AI as Teacher, Not Crutch**
   - Companion explains the "why" behind advice
   - Users learn cognitive science principles
   - Goal: users internalize knowledge

2. **Transparent Recommendations**
   - "I recommend X because Y"
   - Show confidence levels
   - Offer alternatives

3. **Graduated Independence**
   - Early: More AI guidance
   - Middle: Collaborative
   - Advanced: User-led with AI available

4. **Off Switch Always Available**
   - Train without AI anytime
   - No penalty for declining AI
   - Full functionality without AI

---

### Shadow Integration Assessment

**Potential Shadow Expressions:**

| Shadow Risk | Mitigation |
|-------------|------------|
| AI creates cognitive dependency | Sovereignty Gate + graduated independence |
| Gamification becomes addictive | Engagement metrics balance with wellbeing checks |
| Data used for manipulation | Consent framework + third-party audits |
| Personalization creates filter bubble | Diverse recommendation exposure |
| AI companion replaces human connection | Clear AI boundaries + human coach integration |
| Enterprise surveillance concerns | Aggregate-only enterprise reporting |

**Mirror of Multiverse Questions:**

1. *What if users become dependent on AI recommendations and can't train independently?*
   - Design principle: AI teaches principles, not just prescribes actions

2. *What if the Companion becomes a substitute for human relationships?*
   - Clear AI identity, encourage human coach connection, limit interaction depth

3. *What if enterprises use cognitive data for employee surveillance?*
   - Strict aggregate-only policies, individual data never shared
