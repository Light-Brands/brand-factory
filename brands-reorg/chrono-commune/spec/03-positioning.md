  who: "Want to coordinate their time while nurturing their connections"

                   COMMUNITY-FIRST
                      DESIGN
```

### Three Pillars of Differentiation

#### Pillar 1: Community-First Design

```yaml
pillar_community_first:
  tagline: "Built for communities, not corporations."

  description: |
    While competitors optimize for individual productivity or
    treat family as a feature, Chrono-Commune is architected
    from the ground up for groups who share values, not just
    schedules.

  specific_differentiators:
    equal_participation:
      problem: "Apple Family Sharing gives one parent all control"
      solution: "Equal admin capabilities for all designated members"
      message: "Every voice matters in your community."

    flexible_structures:
      problem: "Apps assume nuclear family structure"
      solution: "Support for co-parents, blended families, multi-generational homes"
      message: "Families come in all configurations."

    community_calendar_types:
      problem: "Generic calendar doesn't reflect community identity"
      solution: "Dedicated calendar types for different community configurations"
      message: "Your calendar, your community's way."

  proof_points:
    - "Multiple admin roles per calendar"
    - "Graceful member transitions (divorce, moves)"
    - "Community-specific calendar settings"
    - "Shared memos for informal community communication"
```

#### Pillar 2: Soul-Aligned Scheduling

```yaml
pillar_soul_aligned:
  tagline: "Where every moment has meaning."

  description: |
    Calendars have optimized for efficiency. Chrono-Commune
    optimizes for intention. We help communities schedule
    with purpose, not just productivity.

  specific_differentiators:
    intentionality:
      problem: "Events are logistics, not meaning"
      solution: "Optional purpose/intention field for events"
      message: "Know why you're gathering, not just when."

    mindful_notifications:
      problem: "Constant interrupts create anxiety"
      solution: "Digest-first notifications that respect attention"
      message: "Stay informed without staying interrupted."

    reflection:
      problem: "No space for appreciating shared time"
      solution: "Weekly reflection prompts (optional)"
      message: "Celebrate the time you've shared."

  proof_points:
    - "Daily digest as default (not real-time interrupts)"
    - "Quiet hours enabled by default (10pm-8am)"
    - "No FOMO-inducing notification language"
    - "Event templates for meaningful gatherings"
```

#### Pillar 3: Privacy-Forward by Default

```yaml
pillar_privacy_forward:
  tagline: "Your time is yours. Your data is yours."

  description: |
    Your family's schedule is sacred, not a data product.
    While competitors monetize through advertising or data
    mining, Chrono-Commune is funded by users who value privacy.

  specific_differentiators:
    no_ads_ever:
      problem: "Free tiers funded by intrusive advertising"
      solution: "No advertisements, even in free tier"
      message: "Your calendar, not a billboard."

    no_data_selling:
      problem: "Family activities tracked and monetized"
      solution: "Zero data selling, minimal data collection"
      message: "We don't know you're picking up kids at 3pm."

    data_sovereignty:
      problem: "Data locked in platforms"
      solution: "Full export (iCal + JSON) anytime"
      message: "Leave whenever you want, with everything you own."

  proof_points:
    - "No advertising business model"
    - "Privacy dashboard showing exactly what's stored"
    - "iCal export for any calendar"
    - "Full JSON export of all account data"
    - "Complete account deletion with verification"
```
