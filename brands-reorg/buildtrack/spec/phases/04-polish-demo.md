   - Fence parallel to blade
   - Miter gauge slides smoothly

3. **Dust Collection**
   - Empty dust bag if >50% full
   - Check hose connections
   - Verify suction at blade area

## After Last Use Each Day

1. Lower blade below table surface
2. Clean sawdust from table with brush
3. Apply paste wax to table surface monthly
4. Lock fence and blade height adjustments
```

**2. End-of-Day Shop Cleanup**
```markdown
# End-of-Day Shop Cleanup Checklist

```markdown
# Cabinet Installation: Level & Scribe Procedure

## Tools Required

- 4' level
- Laser level (optional)
- Scribe compass
- Jigsaw with fine blade
- Shims (composite, not wood)
- Pencil

## Procedure

### Step 1: Find the High Point

1. Set laser level at cabinet height (typically 34.5" for base)
2. Check all walls where cabinets will mount
3. Mark the highest point - this is your reference

### Step 2: Install First Cabinet

1. Start at high point with corner cabinet
2. Level front-to-back using shims
3. Level side-to-side
4. Secure to wall through back rail into studs

### Step 3: Scribe Technique

When cabinet meets an uneven wall:

1. Position cabinet plumb and level
2. Set compass to largest gap between cabinet and wall
3. Run compass along wall, marking cabinet side
4. Cut along scribe line with jigsaw (blade angled toward back)
5. Test fit and adjust as needed
```

**4. Time Card Instructions**
```markdown
# How to Fill Out Your Time Card

## Daily Entry

Each day, record:

1. **Date** - Use MM/DD format
2. **Start Time** - When you clocked in
3. **End Time** - When you clocked out
4. **Break Time** - Total break minutes (lunch + other)
5. **Job Code** - From the project board

## Job Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| SHOP | In-shop production work |
| INST | Field installation |
| DLVR | Delivery and transport |
| MEET | Meetings and training |

---

### 4.2 Bug Fixes & Performance

**Goal:** Smooth, fast experience with no visible errors.

#### Critical Bug Sweep

Test and fix:

- [ ] **Auth flows** - Login, magic link, logout all work
- [ ] **Mobile navigation** - No stuck states or broken back buttons
- [ ] **Video playback** - Loads, plays, tracks progress
- [ ] **Form submissions** - Validation, error messages, success states
- [ ] **Data loading** - Loading states, error states, empty states
- [ ] **Role permissions** - Each role sees correct content/actions

#### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| First Contentful Paint | < 1.5s | Lighthouse |
| Time to Interactive | < 3s | Lighthouse |
| Video start time | < 2s | Manual testing |
| Page transitions | < 200ms | Perceived |
| API response time | < 300ms | Network tab |

#### Quick Wins

```typescript
// 1. Image optimization
// Add next/image or sharp for thumbnails
import Image from 'next/image';

// 2. Lazy loading for off-screen content
const ModuleCard = lazy(() => import('./ModuleCard'));

// 3. API response caching
// TanStack Query default staleTime
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
    },
  },
});

// 4. Skeleton loading states
function ModuleCardSkeleton() {
  return (
    <div className="animate-pulse">
      <div className="bg-gray-200 h-32 rounded-t" />
      <div className="p-4 space-y-2">
        <div className="bg-gray-200 h-4 w-3/4 rounded" />
        <div className="bg-gray-200 h-3 w-1/2 rounded" />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Error Handling

Ensure graceful handling for:

- [ ] Network failures (show retry option)
- [ ] 404 pages (helpful message + navigation)
- [ ] Auth errors (redirect to login)
- [ ] Validation errors (inline messages)
- [ ] Server errors (apologetic message)

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No console errors during demo flow
- [ ] No UI flickering or layout shifts
- [ ] Loading states appear for async operations
- [ ] Error states are user-friendly
- [ ] Performance targets met

"Most construction training apps are built like school—long videos,
boring quizzes, click-through courses nobody remembers.

We built something different. BuildTrack feels like it belongs on a
job site. Let me show you."

---

SCENE 2: OWNER SETUP (0:45 - 1:30)

[Click "Start Free Trial"]

[Pick up phone with Expo Go ready, logged in as John]

"Now let's see what John, a new shop hire, experiences."

[Show home screen]

"John sees his personalized onboarding—8 modules, due date, his
progress. No hunting through menus."

[Pull out printed QR code, hold up to camera]

"And here's something cool. We printed QR codes for the shop.
John walks up to the table saw, scans the code..."

[Module opens instantly]

"...and the safety training for THAT machine opens immediately.
Watch, checklist, done. Right where he needs it."

---

SCENE 4: FIELD VIDEO UPLOAD (2:30 - 3:30)

[Switch to Emily's account on phone]

"But the magic is what happens next. Emily's been installing
cabinets for 10 years. She just figured out a trick for scribing
cabinets to uneven walls."

[Open upload screen, select pre-recorded video]

"She pulls out her phone, records a quick tip, picks a category,
and submits. 30 seconds."

[Submit]

"That knowledge used to walk out the door when employees left.
Now it's captured."

---

SCENE 5: ADMIN REVIEW (3:30 - 5:00)

[Switch to web, logged in as Mike/Owner]

"Back at the office, Mike gets a notification. Let's see what
Emily sent."

[Open pending uploads, click review]

"He watches the video... this is gold. Instead of just approving
it, watch this."

[Click "Create Module"]

"One click. The video becomes a training module. He can add a
checklist, a quiz, assign it to the installation track..."

[Add one checklist item, click Publish]

"Done. What took Emily 30 seconds to record now trains every
future installer."

---

SCENE 6: LIVE UPDATE (5:00 - 5:45)

[Pick up phone, show Carlos's account refreshing library]

"Carlos is in the field. He refreshes his library..."

[Show new module appearing with "New" badge]

"Emily's tip is right there. Created today, ready to learn."

---

SCENE 7: SUPERVISOR DASHBOARD (5:45 - 6:30)

[Switch to Dave (Supervisor) on web]

"Dave supervises the install crew. His dashboard shows him:"

- "3 pending video reviews"
- "Carlos is 4 days behind on onboarding"
- "John's OSHA cert expires next week"

"No spreadsheets. No chasing people down. Everything in one place."

---

SCENE 8: CERTIFICATIONS (6:30 - 7:00)

[Click into John's profile, show certification wallet]

"And every employee has a digital wallet of their certifications.
When John completes his table saw training, he's certified. The
system tracks expiry automatically."

[Show expiry warning]

"John knows. Dave knows. Nobody's surprised."

---

SCENE 9: CLOSE (7:00 - 7:30)

[Return to dashboard]

"This is BuildTrack. Training that captures tribal knowledge,
meets workers where they are, and actually gets used.
