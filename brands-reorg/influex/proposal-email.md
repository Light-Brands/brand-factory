# Proposal Email — Dmitriy & Carla

Hey Dmitriy and Carla,

Thanks for taking the time to discuss Influex the other day. The proposal is ready, the architecture is mapped, and the more I dig into what you've built with 200+ premium brands, the more I see how massive this opportunity is.

You've already done the hardest part. The client roster, the methodology, the design taste — that's the moat. What's missing is the platform underneath it. WordPress is eating your margin and capping your scale. We fix that, and Influex becomes the infrastructure layer for premium personal branding. Nobody else is even close.

The master planning session is where this gets real. What I want to walk through:

- **Ecosystem Map** — all components across brand platform, AI, client experience, network, and operations
- **SDLC Blueprint** — automating the build-deploy-maintain pipeline to go from 6-8 week delivery to 1-2 weeks
- **Economics** — the path from ~$100K/month in ops costs to ~$25K/month and 70%+ margins
- **Phase 1 Diagnostic** — validating everything against your actual infrastructure before we build

I want to get into your systems, map every workflow and integration, and design something that actually replaces what's there — not just sits next to it. The end state: a unified platform serving 2,000+ brands with the same design quality you deliver to 200 today, with AI-powered brand generation, automated maintenance, and your Essence-First methodology encoded directly into the system.

Here's the proposal — a great preview of how we work with our clients, and hopefully sparks ideas on how we could incorporate this with yours during our strategy session:

One ask before our first meeting: send me your top 5-8 priorities for the most epic experience you want to create for your clients, so I can align them with our ecosystem map before our call.

Let's get the planning session on the calendar once the proposal is settled — we're ready to scope this out and hit the build button the week before you leave.

Talk soon,
Dan Lawless
