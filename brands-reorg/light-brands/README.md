## The Two-Division Model for Purpose-Driven Brand Creation

---

## Overview

Light Brands operates as a unified brand creation company with a clear structural division:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      LIGHT BRANDS                               │
├────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┤
│   CONSULTING           │   DEVELOPMENT                         │
│   ──────────────       │   ───────────────                     │
│   Client-facing        │   Engineering-focused                 │
│   Sales & delivery     │   Building & QA                       │
│   All clients here     │   No clients here                     │
└────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Core Flow:** Consulting closes work → Development builds → Consulting delivers

---

## Mission

To create brands that illuminate—integrating ethical AI with authentic purpose—through a clean division of client service and engineering excellence.

---

## The Two Divisions

### Light Brands Consulting

The client-facing division handles:
- Client acquisition and sales
- Proposals and contracts
- Client dashboards and communication
- Payment processing
- Delivery coordination
- Relationship management

**Key Principle:** All clients exist within Consulting. Every touchpoint, every conversation, every invoice flows through this division.

### Light Brands Development

The engineering division handles:
- Software development
- AI agent systems
- Visual identity creation
- Platform building
- Quality assurance
- Internal tools and infrastructure

**Key Principle:** No clients allowed. Developers receive anonymized work units and build without client interruption.

## Service Tiers

| Tier | Investment | Focus |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Spark** | $500 - $3,000 | Sessions & audits |
| **Ignite** | $3,000 - $15,000 | Blueprints & foundations |
| **Illuminate** | $15,000 - $50,000 | Full brand creation |

## Key Concepts

### Work Units

The atomic element of work transfer between divisions. Each work unit has:
- Clear scope and deliverables
- Measurable acceptance criteria
- Timeline and priority
- No client identifying information

### Client Dashboard

Every client receives dashboard access providing:
- Project status visibility
- Work unit progress
- Invoice management
- Deliverable downloads
- Communication hub
- Brand asset vault

### Handoff Protocol

Formal process ensuring:
- Clean transfer between divisions
- Quality gates at each stage
- Complete documentation
- Accountability and tracking
