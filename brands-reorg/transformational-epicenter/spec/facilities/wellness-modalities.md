5. **Guest Experience** — Genuinely pleasant and restoring

### The Nervous System Lens

| State | Goal | Modalities That Help |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| **Hyperarousal** | Downregulate, calm | Infrared sauna, massage, breathwork, float |
| **Hypoarousal** | Activate, energize | Cold plunge, movement, contrast therapy |
| **Dysregulation** | Restore window of tolerance | Somatic therapy, HBOT, integration work |
| **Inflammation** | Reduce systemic | Cold therapy, HBOT, red light, IV nutrients |
| **Cellular Fatigue** | Regenerate | NAD+, HBOT, red light, quality sleep |

### Timing Considerations

| Phase | Appropriate | Avoid |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Arrival** | Gentle: sauna, massage, light yoga | Intense: cold plunge, strong breathwork |
| **Pre-Ceremony** | Calming: float, massage, gentle movement | Activating: vigorous exercise, contrast |
| **Post-Ceremony** | Very gentle: light massage, warmth, rest | Almost everything else |
| **Integration Days** | Gradually increasing: somatic, breath, bio-opt | Overwhelming the system |
| **Final Days** | Full access: all modalities | Nothing—full integration |
