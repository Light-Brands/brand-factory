## Key Principles Across Phases

### 1. Quality Before Speed

Every phase prioritizes excellence over velocity. We would rather take longer than compromise standards.

### 2. Foundation Before Building

Each phase creates the foundation for the next. We don't skip steps.

### 3. People First

Team development and culture are as important as facilities and systems.

### 4. Prove Before Replicate

We don't replicate until the model is proven and documented.

### 5. Sustainable Growth

Growth rate never exceeds our capacity to maintain excellence.
