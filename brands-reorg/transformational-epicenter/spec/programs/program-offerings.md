## Program Philosophy

### Time as Container

Transformation cannot be rushed. The nervous system, shaped over a lifetime, needs time to:
- **Settle** — Arrive, decompress, feel safe
- **Open** — Soften defenses, access deeper layers
- **Experience** — The catalytic moment(s)
- **Integrate** — Process, embody, make meaning
- **Anchor** — Build new patterns, prepare for return

Each program duration honors this rhythm at different depths.

### Why Not Shorter?

Many retreat centers offer 3-5 day programs. We don't. Here's why:

| Days | Reality |
|------|---------|
| 1-3 | Still arriving; nervous system on alert |
| 4-5 | Beginning to settle; surface relaxation |
| 6-7 | True settling; ready for deeper work |
| 8-14 | Capacity for medicine work and initial integration |
| 15-21 | Deep integration; pattern interruption takes hold |
| 22-28 | Full transformation arc; embodiment begins |

The medicine is not the transformation—the integration is. Most centers underinvest in integration time. We don't.
