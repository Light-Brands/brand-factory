## Entity Relationship Context (Needs Alignment)

### Umbrella Structure

ChoZen, Future of Cities (FoC), PHXJAX, Tony Cho brand, and M1 Commercial are all **Cho Ventures ventures**. However, the brands and their IP/entities remain **separate**.

### Open Items Requiring Michael + Tony Input

1. **ChoZen <> FoC Relationship**
   - Need to align on IP + partner/investment positioning for how ChoZen interrelates with FoC
   - Must not imply shared ownership or merged entities
   - Requires confirmation from Michael + Tony

2. **Metro 1 <> FoC Relationship**
   - Metro 1 acts as **commercial brokerage support** for FoC
   - Metro 1 is **not** part of the FoC investment entity
   - Distinction: **services relationship** vs. **investment participation**
   - Needs clarification from Tony + Michael

3. **CCRL <> ChoZen IP**
   - Currently in transition; process of defining this interrelationship is ongoing

4. **Next Step**
   - Once Michael/Tony guidance is received, document the clean entity/IP/partner structure and reflect it consistently across all materials

### Legal Entity & IP Boundaries (Key Clarification)

**FoC, CCRL, ChoZen IP, and PHXJAX are separate legal entities.** ChoZen/CCRL do not sit inside FoC from an ownership, rights, or governance standpoint.

**Platform relationship, not entity consolidation:**
- ChoZen can show up within the FoC ecosystem as a program ("classroom") for visibility, learning, and cross-pollination — but that is a **platform relationship**, not entity consolidation
- CCRL is a nonprofit that can **collaborate alongside** FoC
- CCRL's membership/portal is still TBD and may be developed under ChoZen IP and **licensed to CCRL** to support scaling beyond the Florida project
- ChoZen IP holds the relevant IP/brand assets — these are **not automatically shared** with FoC

**IP Ownership — Area to Watch:**
The tricky part is that several concepts originate from FoC thinking but exist as separate entities:
- **ChoZen** = FoC concept (bioregional hub / eco-village / regenerative development)
- **PHXJAX** = FoC concept (arts + innovation district / revitalization / adaptive reuse / warehouse district)
- **HUB** = climate + innovation

These are currently visible in the FoC Figma link (see Resources above) so all current funnels/tech can be seen in one place while the CCRL vs. ChoZen IP structure is finalized.

**To clarify further on the call with Tony and Michael** — goal is to map and communicate this more simply so the structure is clearly understood by all parties.

## Edits to Existing Ecosystem Map

### Funds & Foundations

- M1 Community Fund

**Add:**

- **Cho Family Foundation** — DAF (Donor-Advised Fund)

---

  - Real estate investment
  - Commercial + residential leasing
  - Affordable housing

---

### CCRL (Formerly ChoZen Retreat)

**Replace:** ChoZen Retreat → **ChoZen Center for Regenerative Living (CCRL)** — 501(c)(3)

**CCRL Programs:**
- ChoZen Artisan Market
- Farm Volunteer Days
- Leadership Training
- Weekly Programming
- Artist Residency
- Youth Summer Camp

**Note:** Portions of ChoZen IP are being donated to CCRL.

**Visual Identity & Community Database** — part of CCRL

**Legal/IP Note:** CCRL is a separate legal entity (nonprofit). It does not sit inside FoC from an ownership, rights, or governance standpoint. CCRL collaborates alongside FoC. CCRL's membership/portal is TBD — may be developed under ChoZen IP and licensed to CCRL to support scaling beyond the Florida project.

---

### ChoZen IP (Replace "ChoZen Community")

**Replace:** ChoZen Community → **ChoZen IP**

**ChoZen IP includes:**
- Brand identity & guidelines
- Residential
- Hospitality
- Online membership platform (education + experiences)
- Global community
- **Casa Colibri**
- **Sacred Items Gift Shop** (IRL)
- Online shop (TBD)
- **Tech:** Regenerative living framework, leadership trainings + productization pathway (courses, tools, gamified learning, etc.)

**Legal/IP Note:** ChoZen IP is a separate legal entity from FoC. ChoZen IP holds the relevant IP/brand assets — these are not automatically shared with FoC. ChoZen can appear within the FoC ecosystem as a program ("classroom") for visibility, learning, and cross-pollination, but this is a platform relationship, not entity consolidation. The boundary between ChoZen IP and FoC IP needs to be clearly defined, especially since ChoZen originated as a FoC concept (bioregional hub / eco-village / regenerative development).
