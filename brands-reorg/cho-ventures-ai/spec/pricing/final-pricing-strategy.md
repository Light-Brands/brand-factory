# LIGHT BRANDS
# INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPITAL ACTIVATION PARTNERSHIP

> **Prepared for:** Tony Cho
> **Prepared by:** Light Brands
> **Date:** February 17, 2026
> **Raise Objective:** $12M Capital Alignment

---

## 1. Executive Overview

This proposal outlines the strategic infrastructure required to align the Tony Cho personal brand, Future of Cities initiative, and capital-readiness systems into a unified ecosystem designed to support long-term influence, creative expression, and institutional growth.

The opportunity is unique:

- A strong visionary identity
- A proven track record of creative cultural influence
- Meaningful relationships and network access
- A mission capable of attracting both community participation and institutional capital

The core challenge is structural.

At present, the vision exists across multiple ideas and initiatives without a unified system that clearly shows how people engage, participate, learn, or invest.

Light Brands operates at the intersection of strategy, systems, and execution, building institutional-grade ecosystems that transform vision into aligned momentum and capital readiness.

---

## 2. Strategic Context

Most founders and creators attempt to grow influence, launch products, and raise capital as separate efforts.

This typically results in:

- fragmented messaging
- disconnected offerings
- unclear participation paths
- momentum that depends entirely on the founder

Our methodology integrates these elements into one structured ecosystem.

The sequence becomes:

1. Build infrastructure first
2. Align narrative, products, and identity
3. Activate network and capital pathways
4. Scale with systems already in place

This approach allows momentum to compound rather than reset.

```

### Layer I. Tony Cho Personal Brand Platform

This platform becomes the creative expression of Tony Cho as a visionary, artist, builder, and cultural influence.

**Purpose:**

- Express the creative identity behind the work
- Showcase artistic influence and legacy, including cultural impact such as Wynwood
- Promote personal offerings including books, courses, and educational products
- Serve as the primary vehicle for audience engagement and storytelling

**Strategic Direction:**

This is not simply a personal website. It is a living creative platform that reflects how Tony thinks, builds, and influences culture. The tone and design should feel like an expression of the creator himself.

### Layer II. ChoVerse Ecosystem Hub

ChoVerse serves as the central container connecting all activity within the Tony Cho universe.

**Purpose:**

- Aggregate news, activity, offerings, art, and community initiatives
- Highlight ongoing projects and collaborations
- Create a consistent destination where people follow the broader movement
- Act as the amplification center for ongoing visibility and engagement

ChoVerse sits between personal brand and institutional positioning. It becomes the place where the community experiences the ecosystem in motion.

### Layer III. Future of Cities Platform

Future of Cities remains institutional in tone and execution.

**Purpose:**

- Position the larger mission with professional credibility
- Present projects and initiatives at an institutional level
- Support strategic partnerships and investor confidence

Navigation structure includes clear pathways back to "Meet Tony," ensuring alignment between visionary identity and institutional initiatives.

### Layer IV. InvestOS (Infrastructure Layer)

InvestOS forms the operational foundation beneath the ecosystem.

**Purpose:**

- Capital alignment architecture
- Investor-facing readiness systems
- Structured engagement pathways
- Narrative-to-financial alignment

InvestOS transforms visibility into investability by creating infrastructure that institutional stakeholders can evaluate and trust.

### Layer V. AmplifyOS (Capital and Network Activation Layer)

Once infrastructure is established, AmplifyOS activates the ecosystem across Tony's network and audience.

**Purpose:**

- Strategic amplification of ChoVerse and ecosystem activity
- Promotion of products, launches, and offerings under the personal brand
- Narrative-driven network activation supporting fundraising momentum
- Campaign architecture that converts visibility into participation and investment

AmplifyOS ensures infrastructure becomes movement, not static assets.

## 5. Engagement Philosophy

Light Brands operates as institutional infrastructure partners rather than external vendors.

This partnership integrates strategy, systems, and execution so that vision, identity, and capital move together.

**Engagement Value Range: $650,000 to $800,000**

This reflects the full scope of ecosystem architecture, infrastructure deployment, capital activation systems, and ongoing strategic advisory required to execute at this level. Three payment structures are available under Option 2, ranging from all-cash to equity-aligned partnerships. Typical engagements of this nature begin at $250,000+, reflecting the strategic rigor and integrated execution involved.

---

## 6. Partnership Structure

Because of the strategic opportunity and growth stage of the ecosystem, this partnership is structured as an aligned model where Light Brands' compensation is directly tied to the success of the raise.

All payment structures follow the same milestone framework:

- **10% upfront** upon engagement signing
- **90% deferred**, tied to raise milestones
- **Milestone 1** triggers when 10% of $12M is raised ($1.2M)
- **Milestone 2** triggers when 30% of $12M is raised ($3.6M)

Option 2 is available in three payment structures:

### Option 2A. All Cash

| Component | Amount | Timing |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Upfront (10%)** | $65,000 | Upon engagement signing |
| **Milestone 1 (50% of deferred)** | $292,500 | At $1.2M raised (10% of $12M) |
| **Milestone 2 (50% of deferred)** | $292,500 | At $3.6M raised (30% of $12M) |
| **Total** | **$650,000** | |
| **Equity** | $0 | |

### Option 2B. Cash + Equity Blend

| Component | Amount | Timing |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Upfront (10%)** | $50,000 | Upon engagement signing |
| **Milestone 1 (50% of deferred)** | $225,000 | At $1.2M raised (10% of $12M) |
| **Milestone 2 (50% of deferred)** | $225,000 | At $3.6M raised (30% of $12M) |
| **Total Cash** | **$500,000** | |
| **Equity** | $200,000 | At pre-money NAV ($35.3M) |
| **Total Alignment** | **$700,000** | |

### Option 2C. Equity-Aligned (Recommended)

| Component | Amount | Timing |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Upfront (10%)** | $40,000 | Upon engagement signing |
| **Milestone 1 (50% of deferred)** | $180,000 | At $1.2M raised (10% of $12M) |
| **Milestone 2 (50% of deferred)** | $180,000 | At $3.6M raised (30% of $12M) |
| **Total Cash** | **$400,000** | |
| **Equity** | $400,000 | At pre-money NAV ($35.3M) |
| **Total Alignment** | **$800,000** | |

**The only way Light Brands is paid in full is if the raise succeeds.** This creates complete alignment between both parties. Light Brands bears the execution risk alongside Cho Ventures, ensuring every decision and deliverable is oriented toward capital activation.

### Ongoing Partnership Commitment (Options 2B and 2C)

As an equity partner, Light Brands commits to:

- Ongoing advisory support for the entire Cho Ventures ecosystem
- Strategic guidance on ecosystem growth, positioning, and activation
- Development support for the ChoVerse and connected platforms

**Outcome:**
Creative expression, ecosystem engagement, and capital readiness operate as one unified system. Options 2B and 2C include equity partnership, ensuring Light Brands remains invested in long-term ecosystem success with at-cost future development.

## 8. Strategic Recommendation

Visibility without infrastructure creates fragmentation.
Infrastructure without amplification creates stagnation.

The full ecosystem approach integrates:

- creative identity
- community and activity
- institutional credibility
- capital activation

from the beginning.

### Economics in Context

```mermaid
pie title Option 2C: How the $12M Raise Breaks Down
    "Retained by Cho Ventures (93.3%)" : 93.3
    "Light Brands Cash (3.33%)" : 3.33
    "Light Brands Equity (3.33%)" : 3.33
```

| | **2A: All Cash** | **2B: Blend** | **2C: Equity-Aligned** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Upfront** | $65,000 (0.54%) | $50,000 (0.42%) | $40,000 (0.33%) |
| **Total Cash** | $650,000 (5.42%) | $500,000 (4.17%) | $400,000 (3.33%) |
| **Equity** | $0 (0%) | $200,000 (1.67%) | $400,000 (3.33%) |
| **Total Alignment** | $650,000 (5.42%) | $700,000 (5.83%) | $800,000 (6.67%) |

**What the upfront investment delivers (all options):**

- 15 web portals across the entire Cho Ventures ecosystem
- 5-layer strategic infrastructure (Personal Brand, ChoVerse, FoC, InvestOS, AmplifyOS)
- Capital activation systems aligned to the $12M raise
- Investor-facing ecosystem architecture
- 90% of cash fees only paid if the raise succeeds
- Typical engagements of this nature begin at $250,000+ for a single platform

**What equity unlocks (Options 2B and 2C):**

- Ownership at pre-money NAV of $35.3M that appreciates at post-money ($47.3M)
- Vests only when the full raise closes
- Ensures Light Brands remains a long-term committed partner
- Unlocks at-cost pricing on all future development
- Ongoing advisory and ecosystem development support

Light Brands operates at speed. InvestOS starts day one alongside the platform builds. The full infrastructure is delivered in 8 weeks. AmplifyOS activates on the back side of core platforms going live.

### Phase 1. Infrastructure + InvestOS (Weeks 1-8)

All work runs in parallel from day one:

- Tony Cho personal brand platform (weeks 1-4)
- ChoVerse ecosystem hub (weeks 1-6)
- Future of Cities platform (weeks 2-5)
- InvestOS capital readiness infrastructure (weeks 1-8, concurrent)
- Remaining ecosystem portals (weeks 3-8)

### Phase 2. Activation (Weeks 8-12)

Once core platforms are live, AmplifyOS activates:

- AmplifyOS rollout (beginning of month 3)
- Product launch support
- Network engagement strategy
- Fundraising alignment

### Phase 3. Post-Raise Expansion (Month 4+)

- Ecosystem scaling
- Advanced AI-driven amplification
- Long-term growth infrastructure

## 11. Closing Perspective

You already possess the vision, creativity, and influence required to build something meaningful at scale.

The decision now is sequencing.

Build separate pieces over time, or
Build the full ecosystem once so creativity, community, products, and capital all move together.

Light Brands is prepared to act as a long-term strategic partner in building and activating the infrastructure beneath the ChoVerse.

### Slide 11: Why This Order Matters
**Two Paths Forward**
LEFT: Brand > Attention > Need Infrastructure > Rebuild
RIGHT: Brand + Infrastructure + Amplification > Raise > Scale

### Slide 12: Value Anchor
**Institutional Engagement Level**
$450,000
Total ecosystem architecture and capital activation value.
15 web portals. 5 infrastructure layers. Full ecosystem build.

### Slide 12.5: The Economics
**Three Payment Structures**
- 2A: $650K all cash (5.42% of raise), no equity
- 2B: $500K cash + $200K equity (5.83% of raise), at-cost future work
- 2C: $400K cash + $400K equity (6.67% of raise), at-cost future work
- All structures: 10% upfront, 90% deferred to raise milestones
- Equity priced at pre-money NAV ($35.3M), vests at full raise

### Slide 13: Option 1
**Brand and Ecosystem Foundation**
- Personal Brand Platform
- ChoVerse Hub
- Future of Cities platform
- Investment: $45K upfront
- Outcome: Clear identity and ecosystem cohesion

### Slide 14: Option 2 (Three Structures)
**Full Ecosystem and Capital Activation**
- Everything in Option 1 plus all 15 web portals, InvestOS, AmplifyOS
- 2A: $650K all cash ($65K upfront), no equity
- 2B: $500K cash + $200K equity ($50K upfront), at-cost future work
- 2C: $400K cash + $400K equity ($40K upfront), at-cost future work (Recommended)
- All: 90% deferred, milestones at 10% and 30% of raise
- Equity at pre-money NAV ($35.3M), vests at full raise

### Slide 15: Moment of Truth Close
Build separate pieces over time
OR
Build the ecosystem once.

### Slide 16: Execution Timeline
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-8): Full infrastructure + InvestOS built in parallel, all 15 portals live
- Phase 2 (Weeks 8-12): AmplifyOS activates on the back side of core platforms
- Phase 3 (Month 4+): Raise momentum, ecosystem scaling

### Slide 17: Next Steps
- Confirm direction
- Finalize agreement
- Kickoff alignment session
- Begin ecosystem build

## Speaker Notes

### Ecosystem Diagram Presentation

"This is the entire system in one view."
Pause.
"Your personal brand creates connection and creative energy."
"ChoVerse becomes the living universe where everything happening around you is visible."
"Future of Cities creates institutional credibility."
"InvestOS makes it investable."
"And AmplifyOS activates the whole ecosystem so momentum actually moves toward capital."
Then stop talking. Let them process.

### Slide 6 (Personal Brand)
"This isn't a typical personal brand site. It should feel like a creative expression of you."

### Slide 7 (ChoVerse)
"ChoVerse becomes the universe people enter to stay connected to everything you're building."

### Slide 8 (Future of Cities)
"This is intentionally separate in tone. Institutional clarity lives here."

### Slide 9 (InvestOS)
"InvestOS makes the ecosystem investable."

### Slide 10 (AmplifyOS)
"This is where momentum turns into movement."

### Slide 11 (Why This Order Matters)
"Neither path is wrong. One simply removes future friction."
Pause.

### Slide 12 (Value Anchor)
Pause after saying the number.
"15 web portals for every entity in the ecosystem. Full infrastructure. Capital activation. But we're giving you three ways to structure this because we want to find the path that works best for both sides."
Pause again.
"Every structure has 90% deferred. We only get paid when the raise moves forward."

### Slide 12.5 (The Economics)
"Let me put this in context."
"The all-cash option is $650K. That's 5.4% of the raise. No equity, no ongoing commitment beyond delivery."
"The blend is $500K cash plus $200K in equity. That's $50K upfront. And because we're equity partners, everything we build for you after this engagement is at cost."
"The equity-aligned option is $400K cash plus $400K in equity. $40K upfront. That's one-third of one percent of the raise to start the full ecosystem build."
Pause.
"On the equity-aligned path, our total cash is 3.3% of the raise. 90% of that only gets paid if the raise succeeds. The equity is priced at pre-money NAV of $35.3 million. It only vests when the raise closes."
"The economics here are heavily in your favor regardless of which path you choose."

### Slide 14 (Option 2)
"All three structures get you the same deliverables. All 15 portals. Full ecosystem. InvestOS. AmplifyOS. Capital alignment."
"The difference is how we're compensated and how deep the partnership goes."
"All cash at $650K is straightforward. You pay for the build, we deliver, engagement ends."
"The blend and equity-aligned options bring us in as long-term partners. We take equity at pre-money valuation, it vests when the raise closes. In exchange, everything we build for you beyond this engagement is at cost. No margin. Because we're invested in the outcome, not the invoice."
"We recommend the equity-aligned path because it creates the deepest alignment. $40K starts the build. We don't get paid unless the raise works. And we stay committed to the ecosystem long after this engagement."

### Slide 15 (Close)
Use the 90-second close.
End with: "Which path feels more aligned with how you want to build this?"
Silence.

### Slide 17 (Final 3 minutes)
Reconfirm decision.
Future project.
"From our side we're clear this is the right path."
