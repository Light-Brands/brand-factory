# Phase 1: Discovery & Strategy Session

> *The strategic planning session deliverable is a master plan on how to unify and AI-empower the entire Cho Ventures ecosystem.*

---

## Overview

Phase 1 is a comprehensive deep-dive into every aspect of the Cho Ventures portfolio. Unlike a typical single-entity discovery, this session maps relationships, synergies, and opportunities across the entire ecosystem—from Metro 1 Commercial to CCRL, from the upcoming book to the ChoZen IP platform.

The deliverable is a unified master plan that provides the blueprint for transforming disconnected entities into an AI-powered regenerative ecosystem.
