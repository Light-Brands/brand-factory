# Decision Framework

> *"The quality of decisions determines the quality of outcomes."*

---

## Overview

This document establishes how decisions are made in Earth Weavers. Clear decision-making prevents both paralysis (everyone must agree) and autocracy (one person decides everything).

---

## Decision Types

### Type 1: Reversible Operational Decisions
**Examples:** Venue choice, vendor selection, marketing copy, schedule adjustments

**Characteristics:**
- Can be changed without major cost
- Impact is contained
- Time-sensitive

**Process:**
- Decided by relevant role holder
- No approval needed
- Document decision
- Inform affected parties

**Speed Target:** 48 hours

---

### Type 2: Significant Programmatic Decisions
**Examples:** Selection criteria changes, event format modifications, new program elements

**Characteristics:**
- Affects multiple stakeholders
- Sets precedent
- Some investment to reverse

**Process:**
- Proposed by relevant role holder
- Consult affected parties
- Founding Circle reviews
- Document rationale

**Speed Target:** 1 week

---

### Type 3: Strategic Decisions
**Examples:** New regions, major partnerships, budget over $50K, governance changes

**Characteristics:**
- Long-term implications
- Significant resource commitment
- Hard to reverse

**Process:**
- Analysis and proposal prepared
- Stakeholder input gathered
- Founding Circle deliberates
- Council consulted if mission-affecting
- Formal vote or consensus

**Speed Target:** 2-4 weeks

---

### Type 4: Cultural/Sacred Decisions
**Examples:** Ceremony design, indigenous elements, ritual protocols

**Characteristics:**
- Spiritual and cultural implications
- Potential for harm if wrong
- Require deep consideration

**Process:**
- Proposed by Cultural Lead
- IAC reviews thoroughly
- IAC can veto
- No override of IAC veto possible
- Document permissions and attributions

**Speed Target:** Variable (cannot be rushed)

---

### Type 5: Mission-Critical Decisions
**Examples:** Core principle changes, existential direction, fundamental restructuring

**Characteristics:**
- Affects fundamental identity
- Essentially irreversible
- Defines who we are

**Process:**
- Extensive stakeholder engagement
- Full Council review
- Founding Circle + Council consensus
- May require extended deliberation
- Written ratification

**Speed Target:** Whatever is needed (no rushing)

## The RACI Matrix

For every decision, clarify:

| Role | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **R**esponsible | Does the work to prepare/execute the decision |
| **A**ccountable | Has final authority (ONE person/body only) |
| **C**onsulted | Asked for input before decision |
| **I**nformed | Told about decision after it's made |

### Core RACI (Phase 0-1)

| Decision | R | A | C | I |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Daily operations | Brand Steward | Brand Steward | — | Team |
| Event logistics | Event Lead | Brand Steward | Ops team | All |
| Team selection | Program Lead | Wisdom Council | Event Lead | Founding Circle |
| Budget (under $10K) | Finance Lead | Brand Steward | — | Founding Circle |
| Budget (over $10K) | Finance Lead | Founding Circle | Brand Steward | All |
| Ceremony elements | Cultural Lead | IAC | Founding Circle | All |
| New partnerships | Brand Steward | Founding Circle | Council Liaison | All |
| Crisis response | Brand Steward | Brand Steward | 1+ Founding Circle | All (after) |
| Strategic direction | Brand Steward | Founding Circle | Council | All |
| Mission/principle changes | Founding Circle | Council + Founding Circle | All stakeholders | Public |

## Decision Modes

### 1. Unilateral (Type 1)
One person decides. Fast. Use for operational matters.

### 2. Consultative (Type 2)
One person decides after gathering input. Balances speed and inclusion.

### 3. Consent-Based (Type 3, 4)
Proposal advances unless someone has a principled objection (not just preference). Not unanimity — no objections means proceed.

### 4. Consensus (Type 5)
All parties actively agree. Used only for mission-critical. Can be slow.

### 5. Vote
Majority or supermajority decides. Used when consensus fails and decision must be made.

## Tie-Breaking

When a decision is stuck:

1. **Return to principles** — What do core values suggest?
2. **Return to mission** — Which option better serves our purpose?
3. **Seek more information** — Is the block due to uncertainty?
4. **Time-box deliberation** — Set deadline to prevent paralysis
5. **Escalate** — Higher body breaks the tie
6. **Default to status quo** — If undecidable, don't change

**Ultimate Tie-Breaker Hierarchy:**
1. IAC veto (on cultural matters) — cannot be overridden
2. Council guidance — strong advisory weight
3. Founding Circle vote — final for most matters
4. Brand Steward — for operational emergencies

## Decision Quality Practices

### Before Deciding
- [ ] Is the decision-maker clear?
- [ ] Is there enough information?
- [ ] Have affected parties been consulted?
- [ ] Are there principled objections?
- [ ] What's the reversibility if we're wrong?

### When Deciding
- [ ] State the decision clearly
- [ ] Document the rationale
- [ ] Note what was considered and rejected
- [ ] Identify who was consulted
- [ ] Set review date if appropriate

### After Deciding
- [ ] Inform all affected parties
- [ ] Execute promptly
- [ ] Track outcomes
- [ ] Learn and adjust

## Objection Handling

Not all disagreement is the same:

| Type | Definition | Response |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Preference** | "I'd prefer something else" | Note, but proceed |
| **Concern** | "I'm worried about X" | Address the concern, then proceed |
| **Objection** | "This violates our principles/will cause harm" | Must be resolved before proceeding |
| **Veto** | "This crosses a line I cannot accept" | Only IAC has veto (on culture); investigate alternatives |

**Valid Objections Must:**
- Be principled (connected to values/mission)
- Be specific (clear about the problem)
- Be resolvable (proposer can modify)
- Not be blocking for blocking's sake

---

## Emergency Decision Protocol

When immediate action is required:

1. **Brand Steward decides** immediately
2. **Consult at least one Founding Circle member** if possible
3. **Document the decision and rationale**
4. **Inform Founding Circle within 24 hours**
5. **Review at next Founding Circle meeting**
6. **Learn and update protocols**

**Definition of Emergency:**
- Immediate harm if no action
- Opportunity lost if delayed
- Reputational crisis unfolding
- Safety issue

## Documentation Requirements

Every significant decision should have:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Date | When decided |
| Decision | What was decided |
| Decider | Who had authority |
| Rationale | Why this choice |
| Consulted | Who gave input |
| Alternatives considered | What else was considered |
| Dissent (if any) | Who disagreed and why |
| Review date (if applicable) | When to revisit |

### Decision Log Template

```
## Decision: [Brief title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Type:** [1-5]
**Decider:** [Name/Body]

### Context
[What prompted this decision]

### Decision
[Clear statement of what was decided]

### Rationale
[Why this option was chosen]

### Alternatives Considered
- [Option A] — [Why not chosen]
- [Option B] — [Why not chosen]

### Consulted
- [Name/Role] — [Their input]

### Dissent
[Any principled objections and how addressed]

### Implications
[What changes as a result]

### Review
[If/when this will be revisited]
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Analysis paralysis | Nothing gets decided | Time-box, escalate |
| Consultation theater | Input gathered but ignored | Close loop with consulted |
| Veto creep | Everyone can block everything | Clarify who has veto |
| Decision drift | Old decisions quietly abandoned | Document, review |
| Accountability diffusion | "We all decided" | Single A in RACI |
| Speed addiction | Decisions made without thought | Slow down for Type 3+ |
