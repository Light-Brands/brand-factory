## Detailed Risk Analysis

### C1: Cultural Appropriation Accusations

**Root Causes:**
- Ceremony used without genuine permission
- Indigenous aesthetics borrowed without relationship
- Extraction of wisdom without reciprocity
- Tokenistic inclusion without real partnership

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Indigenous partners expressing discomfort

- IAC members disengaging
- Cultural elements used without IAC approval

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Complete Gate 1 fully before proceeding
2. IAC veto power is real and respected
3. Relationship-first approach with indigenous communities
4. 10%+ reciprocal funding to indigenous communities
5. Cultural impact assessment for all elements
6. Attribution and consent protocols

**Contingency (if occurs):**
1. Pause immediately
2. Listen and acknowledge without defensiveness
3. Consult with IAC and affected communities
4. Make genuine amends
5. Redesign problematic elements
6. Commit to ongoing relationship repair
