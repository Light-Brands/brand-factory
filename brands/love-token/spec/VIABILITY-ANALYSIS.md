## 1. Tokenomics Structure Analysis

### 1.1 Dual Currency Architecture

The system employs a thoughtful dual-currency model:

| Currency | Purpose | Audience | Transferable | Redeemable |
|----------|---------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Love Points (LP)** | Recognition | Global users | No | No |
| **Love Credits (LVC)** | Economic value | Love Farmers | Yes (local) | Yes (vendors) |

**Analysis:** This separation is well-designed. Love Points provide gamification without financial risk, while Love Credits create real economic value for underserved communities.

**Viability Score:** 9/10

### 1.2 Participation Layer Structure

| Layer | Participants | Commitment | Staking | Capital |
|-------|--------------|------------|---------|---------|
| Angels | 22 | $222,000 | 4+ years | $4.4M |
| Layer 1 | 222 | $22,000 | 3+ years | $4.44M |
| Layer 2 | 4,884 | $2,222 | 2+ years | $9.77M |
| Layer 3 | 107,448 | $222 | 1+ year | ~$21.5M |
| Layer 4 | Open | $22 | 6 months | Variable |

**Phase 1 Totals:** 5,128 participants, $18.6M capital, ~$2M TWGE funding

**Analysis:**

| Element | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| **Sacred 22 Structure** | Aesthetically coherent and creates memorable tiers |
| **Capital Requirements** | High barrier at Angel/L1 levels may limit pool |
| **Staking Periods** | Aggressive but manageable for committed participants |
| **Scaling Math** | The 22×22 expansion is elegant but creates fixed caps |

**Viability Score:** 7/10

### 1.3 Revenue Model

**Transaction Fee Structure:**
```
Sender Fee:   2.2%  →  50% Protocol Treasury / 50% TWGE
Receiver Fee: 2.2%  →  50% Protocol Treasury / 50% TWGE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:        4.4%  →  2.2% Protocol / 2.2% TWGE
```

**Analysis:**

| Aspect | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **Fee Level** | 4.4% is high compared to traditional payment rails (1-3%) |
| **Split Structure** | 50/50 split ensures mission funding |
| **Sustainability** | Requires high transaction velocity to generate meaningful revenue |
| **Competitive Position** | May discourage large transactions |

**Projected Revenue at Scale (Illustrative):**

| Monthly Volume | Annual Revenue | TWGE Share |
|----------------|----------------|------------|
| $100,000 | $52,800 | $26,400 |
| $500,000 | $264,000 | $132,000 |
| $1,000,000 | $528,000 | $264,000 |

**Viability Score:** 6/10

### 1.4 Credit Economics

**Issuance Rates:**
- Base: 0.01 LVC per meditation minute
- Individual bonus: +10%
- Day 7 streak: +50%
- Day 30 streak: +100%
- Monthly bonus: +5%

**Analysis:**

| Metric | Calculation | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **1 hour meditation** | 0.66-0.73 LVC (~$0.66-$0.73) | Low but sustainable |
| **Daily committed farmer** | ~30 min = $0.33-$0.40/day | ~$10-12/month |
| **With streaks** | Could reach $15-20/month | Meaningful in target markets |

**Critical Question:** Is $10-20/month sufficient motivation for sustained participation?

**Viability Score:** 7/10
