## Overview

This document provides detailed operational specifications for each participation layer in the Love Token currency ecosystem. It defines the rules, requirements, and progression mechanics for participants at each level.

## The Sacred Number 22

The number 22 serves as the foundational design principle throughout the participation structure:

| Application | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Angel count | 22 |
| Participants per cohort | 22 |
| Layer 1 cohorts | 22 |
| Layer 2 cohorts | 222 |
| Layer 3 cohorts | 4,884 |
| Base currency unit | $22 |
| Commitment multiples | $22, $222, $2,222, $22,000, $222,000 |

**Significance:** In numerology and sacred geometry, 22 represents the Master Builder — one who can turn dreams into reality. This aligns with the mission of building a love-based economy.

## Cohort Progression Rules

### Sequential Opening

Cohorts within each layer open sequentially:

1. New cohort opens when previous cohort reaches capacity (22 participants)
2. Each cohort has a maximum fill period before next cohort opens regardless
3. Early cohorts may have additional benefits (first-mover acknowledgment)

### Waitlist Management

When a layer is full:

1. Prospective participants join waitlist
2. Waitlist priority: referrals from existing participants, then chronological
3. Waitlist members notified when next layer opens
4. No guaranteed access — values alignment still required

### Upgrade Path

Participants may upgrade to higher layers:

1. **Layer 2 → Layer 1:** Apply during Layer 1 open period, pay differential
2. **Layer 3 → Layer 2:** Apply during Layer 2 open period, pay differential
3. **Any Layer → Angel:** By invitation only

Lockup periods reset to new layer requirements upon upgrade.

## Compliance Considerations

### Important Disclaimers

1. **Not Investment Advice:** Participation is values-aligned membership, not financial investment
2. **No Appreciation Guarantee:** The system does not promise or imply value appreciation
3. **Membership Focus:** Commitment is framed as TWGE membership with protocol participation
4. **Risk Acknowledgment:** All participants acknowledge long lockup periods

### KYC/AML Requirements

| Layer | KYC Level | Accreditation |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Angels | Enhanced | Required |
| Layer 1 | Full | Recommended |
| Layer 2 | Standard | Not required |
| Layer 3 | Basic | Not required |
| Layer 4 | Minimal | Not required |
