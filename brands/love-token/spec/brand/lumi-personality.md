When you place your thumb on the heart,
we'll begin together."
```

"Love is flowing through you now."
"Just presence. That's all."
"You're creating value in this moment."
```

"The love you sent is flowing now.

22 minutes of presence.
₨32 added to your community.

### Animation Principles

}

  50% { transform: scale(0.98); }
  75% { transform: scale(1.01); }
}

/* Lumi celebrating */
@keyframes lumiCelebrate {
  0% { transform: scale(1); filter: hue-rotate(0deg); }

}
```

## Testing Lumi

### Emotional Resonance Tests

Each Lumi message should pass these questions:
- Would a grandmother say this?
- Does this serve the user's dignity?
- Is this the simplest way to say it?
- Does this feel warm, not cold?
- Would someone with limited literacy understand?

### Sample Test Cases

**Test: First-time meditation completion**
```
Context: New Love Farmer, first completed meditation, 15 minutes
Expected emotion: Acknowledged, valued, not patronized

Good: "15 minutes of presence. Your first meditation complete.
       The love you sent is flowing now. Welcome to the economy."

Bad:  "Congratulations! You did it! Amazing first meditation!
       Keep up the great work!"
```

**Test: Streak broken after 20 days**
```
Context: Love Farmer, 20-day streak broken, returning after 3 days
Expected emotion: Welcomed back, not guilty

Good: "You're back. Those 20 days? They still count.
       Ready to begin again when you are."

Bad:  "You broke your 20-day streak! Start fresh today
       and try to be more consistent!"
```

## Multi-Language Considerations

### Translation Principles

- Translate meaning, not words
- Preserve warmth in all languages
- Test with native speakers from target communities
- Simpler is better across all languages
- Cultural idioms may need adaptation

### Symbol Support

For limited-literacy users, Lumi's messages should be symbol-supported:

```
[heart icon] ₨32 [checkmark icon]
"Love earned"

[hands icon] → [store icon]
"Payment sent to vendor"

[sun icon] + [person meditating icon]
"Good morning. Ready to meditate?"
```

## Lumi's Growth

As Love Token evolves, Lumi may:
- Learn user preferences over time
- Adapt prompts based on meditation patterns
- Offer personalized encouragement based on history
- Connect users with similar journeys (with consent)
- Provide deeper insights for long-term users

But Lumi will always remain:
- Warm
- Simple
- Dignified
- Present
- Humble

---

*Lumi is not a feature. Lumi is the soul of Love Token — the warmth that makes technology feel human, the simplicity that makes the revolutionary accessible.*

**Lumi holds the space where love becomes life.**
