## The Voice of Love Token

Love Token speaks with the voice of a **wise grandmother** — warm, grounded, clear, and deeply loving. Not performative positivity, not corporate speak, not spiritual jargon. Simple truth, spoken with love.

### Core Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Sounds Like | Not Like |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Warm** | Genuine caring | "Welcome. We've been waiting for you." | "Welcome to the platform!" |
| **Grounded** | Practical wisdom | "Your love became ₨32 today." | "You manifested abundance!" |
| **Clear** | Simple truth | "You earned credits. They're ready to spend." | "Your credits have been successfully processed." |
| **Dignified** | Respect always | "Your meditation creates value." | "Great job meditating!" |
| **Alive** | Love in motion | "Love is flowing through you now." | "Transaction complete." |

### The Tone Spectrum

## Writing Principles

### The Sacred Three

**1. Dignity First**
Every word must serve the dignity of the user. Love Farmers are not beneficiaries — they are value creators. Donors are not saviors — they are participants. No pity, no hierarchy, no othering.

```
❌ "Help those in need"
✅ "Join the Love Economy"

❌ "Your donation helps the poor"
✅ "Your love flows to communities creating value"

❌ "Thank you for helping"
✅ "Thank you for participating"
```

**2. Love as Currency**
Speak of love as something real, practical, and powerful — not abstract or metaphorical. Love Credits are real. Meditation creates real value. This is not poetry; it is economics.

```
❌ "Feel the love"
✅ "Your love is now ₨157"

❌ "Spread positivity"
✅ "Send love to a donor waiting to receive"

❌ "Good vibes"
✅ "22 minutes of presence"
```

**3. Simplicity is Respect**
Complex language excludes. Jargon distances. Simple words include everyone. This is especially critical for Love Farmers who may have limited literacy.

```
❌ "Your transaction has been processed"
✅ "Love sent"

❌ "Navigate to the wallet interface"
✅ "See your credits"

❌ "Redemption request submitted"
✅ "Cash coming soon"
```

## Microcopy Patterns

### Labels

Use sentence case. Be specific. Lead with what it is.

```
✅ "Love Credits balance"
❌ "Balance"

✅ "Meditation minutes today"
❌ "Minutes"

✅ "Community goal progress"
❌ "Progress"
```

### Placeholders

Provide examples that feel human.

```
✅ "Enter amount (e.g., ₨50)"
❌ "Enter amount"

✅ "Search vendors"
❌ "Search"

✅ "Your name"
❌ "Full name"
```

### Help Text

Explain the why, not just the what.

```
✅ "Group meditations help your whole community earn together."
❌ "Enter group meditation details."

✅ "Presence verification ensures everyone's meditation counts fairly."
❌ "Keep your thumb on the screen."
```

### Timestamps

Use relative time. Human, not technical.

```
✅ "Just now" / "5 minutes ago" / "Yesterday" / "Last week"
❌ "2026-01-10 14:32:07"

✅ "Earned this morning"
❌ "Earned at 09:15 AM"
```

## Numbers & Currency

### Love Credits Display

**Primary:** Always show local currency prominently
**Secondary:** Show LVC in smaller text below

```
₨157
4.65 Love Credits
```

### Large Numbers

Use commas for thousands. Round for readability.

```
✅ "2,400 meditation minutes"
❌ "2400.00 meditation minutes"

✅ "₨12,500 earned this month"
❌ "₨12,547.23 earned this month"
```

### Time Display

For meditation: Use minutes primarily.

```
✅ "22 minutes"
❌ "0:22:00"

✅ "1 hour, 15 minutes" (for longer sessions)
❌ "75 minutes"
```

---

## Inclusive Language

### Dignity in Poverty

Never use: poor, needy, underprivileged, beneficiaries, recipients
Use instead: communities, participants, Love Farmers, value creators

```
❌ "Help people in poverty"
✅ "Join communities creating value"

❌ "Donate to the poor"
✅ "Participate in the Love Economy"
```

### Gender & Identity

Use neutral language. Avoid assumptions.

```
✅ "They earned 22 minutes"
❌ "He/she earned 22 minutes"

✅ "Love Farmers and their families"
❌ "Farmers and their wives"
```

### Cultural Sensitivity

Avoid Western spiritual assumptions. Be universal.

```
❌ "Namaste" (appropriation if not from that culture)
✅ "Welcome" / "Peace"

❌ "Karma" (loaded term)
✅ "What you give returns to you"
```
