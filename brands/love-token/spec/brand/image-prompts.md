## Brand Visual Guidelines Summary

Before generating any image, remember these core principles:

### Color Palette Reference

### What to Avoid
- Stock photo aesthetics (perfect lighting, staged smiles)

- Sterile spiritual imagery (too clean, too white, too perfect)
- Anything that diminishes human dignity

## 1. HERO SECTION IMAGES

### 1.1 Homepage Hero — "The Love Economy"

**Primary Hero Image**
```
A diverse group of people sitting in peaceful meditation outdoors at golden hour.
They sit on woven mats in a semi-circle in a warm, earthy courtyard with terracotta
tiles and clay pots with green plants. Natural sunlight streams through, casting
long golden shadows. The people wear simple, colorful traditional clothing in
warm tones—dusty rose, terracotta, cream, and sage green. Their expressions are
serene but grounded, feet planted on earth. Soft focus background with hints of
a simple village or community center. Color palette: warm earth tones with

documentary, natural light, warm color temperature. Aspect ratio: 16:9 wide.
```

```
Close-up of diverse hands resting on knees in meditation mudra, arranged in a
circle on a woven natural fiber mat. Golden sunlight illuminates the hands from
the side, creating warm highlights. Visible details: weathered working hands,
young smooth hands, hands with simple bangles and thread bracelets. The hands
are relaxed, palms up, embodying receiving and giving. Earth-toned background
with subtle texture of natural clay or wood. Color grading: warm, +10% orange,
soft shadows. Photography style: intimate documentary. Aspect ratio: 21:9 ultrawide.
```

### 1.2 Meditation Page Hero

**Meditation Journey Entrance**
```
A single person (gender-neutral presentation) sitting in peaceful meditation
facing a sunrise over gentle hills. View from behind/side angle. They sit on
a simple woven mat on red-brown earth. The sky transitions from deep dusk
purple (#6B5B7A) at the top to warm rose (#C06C84) to golden yellow (#D4A574)
at the horizon. Gentle morning mist rises from the valley below. Simple
traditional clothing in cream and earth tones. One small clay oil lamp
(diya) glowing beside them. Natural, unretouched feeling. Quiet dignity.
Photography style: cinematic landscape, natural light. Aspect ratio: 16:9.
```

**Meditation Timer Background**
```
Abstract macro photography of morning light filtering through simple muslin
fabric, creating soft waves of illumination. Colors transition from sacred
cream (#FAF7F2) through soft rose (#E8D5E0) to gentle hints of heart rose
(#C06C84). Dreamy, peaceful, breathing quality. No recognizable objects—pure
light and texture. Subtle grain for organic feel. Could be fabric, could be
clouds, could be breath made visible. Photography style: abstract, macro,
soft focus. Aspect ratio: 1:1 square.
```

### 1.3 About Page Hero

**Community Purpose**
```
Wide shot of a village community gathering in early morning. People of all
ages—elders, adults, children—gathered in a central courtyard. Some sit in
meditation, some stand in quiet conversation, some children play gently at
the edges. Architecture is simple: clay walls, wooden beams, plants in clay
pots. Morning light bathes the scene in warm gold. Traditional colorful
clothing throughout—saris, kurtas, simple dresses in dusty rose, cream,
sage, and terracotta. The mood is everyday sacred—ordinary people in
ordinary connection. No performances. Real life. Photography style:
wide-angle documentary, warm natural light. Aspect ratio: 21:9.
```

### 1.4 How It Works Page Hero

**The Flow of Love**
```
A flowing river seen from above at golden hour, gentle S-curves moving
through green and golden landscapes. The water reflects warm sunset colors—
rose, gold, and soft purple. Along the banks: small figures of people in
community—working fields, gathered in circles, walking paths. The river
symbolizes love flowing through community. Painterly quality, not
photorealistic. Warm earth tones dominate. Aerial/bird's eye perspective.
Art style: watercolor-influenced digital painting, soft edges, warm palette.
Aspect ratio: 16:9.
```

loved. Dignity radiates. Photography style: portrait, natural light,
shallow depth of field. Aspect ratio: 3:4 vertical.

illuminates profile. Photography style: environmental portrait, golden hour.
Aspect ratio: 3:4.
```

### 2.2 Vendors & Markets

**Village Market Scene**
```
Warm, bustling village market at mid-morning. Vendors sit behind displays of
colorful vegetables, grains, handmade goods. Fabric awnings in faded reds
and oranges create dappled shade. People move through—shopping, chatting,
a child holds parent's hand. One vendor smiles while wrapping goods in
newspaper. The scene is alive with dignified commerce. Nothing looks poor—
this is abundance. Colors: warm naturals with pops of vegetable colors
(eggplant purple, tomato red, turmeric gold). Photography style: street
documentary, warm color grade. Aspect ratio: 3:2.
```

skilled hands in motion. Natural light from doorway or window. Tools of
trade visible, work in progress. Colors: earth tones of materials (clay,
natural fibers, wood) with craft details in warm colors. The person is a
creator of value, not an object of pity. Dignity in skilled work.
Photography style: environmental portrait, documentary. Aspect ratio: 1:1.
```

### 2.3 Community Connection

**Hands Exchanging**

receives. Could be passing food, goods, or simply touching in greeting.
The hands show diversity—different ages, different stories. Soft natural
light. Background warmly blurred—could be market, home, or gathering.
No visible money—this is love being exchanged, not transaction. Warmth
radiates from the connection. Photography style: detail shot, shallow
depth of field, warm tones. Aspect ratio: 16:9.
```

**Intergenerational Moment**
```
An elder and young person sitting together, not posing—genuine interaction.
Perhaps the elder is teaching the young person to use a phone, or they're
sharing a meal, or simply sitting in companionable silence. Natural
setting—home veranda, courtyard, under a tree. Warm late afternoon light.
Traditional and simple modern clothing together. The mood is everyday love—
unremarkable, constant, precious. Photography style: candid, environmental
portrait. Aspect ratio: 3:2.
```

**Community Celebration**
```
A community gathered for modest celebration. No extravagance—perhaps a
shared meal, a completion ceremony, a milestone acknowledgment. Decorations
are simple: marigold flowers, fabric banners, clay lamps. People are smiling,
connecting, celebrating together. Mix of ages, mix of roles. The joy is
real and grounded. Evening light with warm artificial light from lamps.
Colors: warm orange and gold dominant. Photography style: event documentary,
natural lighting mix. Aspect ratio: 16:9.

## Usage Notes

### Image Generation Tools
These prompts are optimized for:
- Midjourney (add `--ar 16:9` for aspect ratio, `--style raw` for documentary feel)
- DALL-E 3 (prompts work as-is, may need aspect ratio specification)
- Stable Diffusion (may need negative prompts for stock photo aesthetics)

### Negative Prompts (for SD-based tools)
```
stock photo, sterile, overlit, perfect lighting, staged, white background,
corporate, cold, blue tint, flash photography, artificial, plastic,
poverty porn, dirty, ragged, pity, charity, donation, poor people,
Western yoga, minimalist white studio, levitating, floating, ethereal,
New Age, crystals, too clean, too perfect, celebrity, model, posed
```

### Testing Brand Alignment
For each generated image, verify:
- [ ] Warm color temperature present
- [ ] Dignity preserved (no pity framing)
- [ ] Natural/documentary feel (not stock)
- [ ] Earth tones dominant
- [ ] Real or authentic-feeling subjects
- [ ] Grounded spirituality (not floaty/ethereal)
