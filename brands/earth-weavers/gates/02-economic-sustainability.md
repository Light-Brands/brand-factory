# Gate 2: Economic Sustainability

> *"Beautiful vision without viable economics is just expensive dreaming."*

## Gate Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Gate Number** | 2 |
| **Name** | Economic Sustainability |
| **Council Owner** | ⚖️ Steward of Exchange |
| **Legion Support** | Measurekeepers, Offerers, Redeemers |
| **Timeline** | 2-4 months |
| **Status** | 🔴 Not Started |

## Purpose

This gate ensures that Earth Weavers has a viable, sustainable financial model — not just for launch, but for long-term thriving. The original proposal relies heavily on philanthropic funders, conscious brands, and donations. This is vulnerable to donor fatigue and economic downturns.

The Steward of Exchange requires that money be treated as "conscious energy" — but conscious energy still needs to flow sustainably. This gate ensures the math works alongside the meaning.

---

## The Problem Being Addressed

The original Earth Weavers proposal has economic gaps:

1. **Dependency Model:** Relies on philanthropy and sponsorship without earned revenue
2. **Participant Economics Unclear:** What do non-winning teams receive?
3. **Labor Invisibility:** Who builds, runs, and supports — and are they fairly paid?
4. **Scale Economics Unknown:** What does it actually cost to run global events?
5. **No Contingency Planning:** What happens if funding dries up?

Without addressing these, Earth Weavers could:
- Launch with fanfare, then collapse when grants end
- Exploit passionate volunteers under "conscious" branding
- Create participant inequity (winners thrive, others lose time/money)
- Scale prematurely and burn through resources

**Questions to Answer:**

---

### 5. Funding Contingency Scenarios

**Requirement:** Plan for economic uncertainty with multiple scenarios.

**Specifications:**
- **Scenario A (Abundant):** 120%+ of target funding achieved
- **Scenario B (Baseline):** 100% of target funding achieved
- **Scenario C (Constrained):** 70% of target funding achieved
- **Scenario D (Crisis):** 50% or less of target funding achieved

For each scenario, define:
- What activities continue/pause/stop?
- What happens to participants and projects?
- How is the organization's survival ensured?
- What triggers escalation between scenarios?

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] 4-scenario contingency plan
- [ ] Trigger points for each scenario
- [ ] Essential vs. optional activities list
- [ ] Communication plan for stakeholders

---

- Reserves are protected, not spent on expansion

**Deliverables:**

## Guiding Questions

The Steward asks these questions to determine completion:

1. **Could this survive a recession?** If philanthropy dried up, would Earth Weavers die?

2. **Is anyone being exploited?** Are "volunteers" actually essential unpaid workers?

3. **Are participants set up to succeed or suffer?** Does losing the competition harm them?

4. **Is this extractive or regenerative economically?** Does money flow to healing or just to spectacle?

5. **What happens in Year 5 if grants end?** Is there a path to self-sustainability?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Why Harmful |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Grant dependency | 80%+ revenue from one funder | Collapse risk when grant ends |
| Volunteer exploitation | "We can't pay you, but it's meaningful!" | Unsustainable, unjust |
| Winner-take-all | Only funded teams get support | Harms non-winners |
| Optimism bias | Only modeling best-case scenario | Unprepared for reality |
| Scale addiction | "We'll figure out money later, just grow" | Leads to compromise or collapse |
| Hidden labor | Event looks cheap but someone's unpaid | Dishonest accounting |
