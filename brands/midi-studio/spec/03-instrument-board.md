# The 8 Instruments — Full Control Mappings

> Each instrument's 4 controls explained: what they do, why, and how they interact.

The same 4-dimensional model (Range, Depth, Expression, Mode) applies universally, but what each dimension *means* is specific to the instrument's physics and musical role.

## Channel 1: Guitar (GTR)

**Role in the mix:** Rhythm foundation, melodic color, harmonic texture.

| Control | Parameter | Left/Bottom Extreme | Center/Default | Right/Top Extreme |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Range** (knob) | Fret position / octave | Open strings, low power chords | Mid-neck, versatile range | Upper frets, high lead lines |
| **Depth** (knob) | Pick/strum intensity | Gentle fingertip brush | Moderate pick attack | Aggressive full strum |
| **Expression** (slider) | Tone color | Warm, round, neck-pickup | Balanced | Bright, cutting, bridge-pickup |
| **Mode** (spinner) | Playing style | — | — | — |

**Modes (5):**
1. **Fingerpick** — Individual string plucking, melodic patterns
2. **Strum** — Full chord strumming, rhythmic drive
3. **Arpeggiate** — Broken chord patterns, flowing movement
4. **Palm Mute** — Muted, percussive, chunky rhythm
5. **Power Chord** — Distorted fifths, rock/metal foundation

**How they interact:** At low Range + low Depth + Fingerpick mode, you get gentle acoustic bass-note fingerpicking. Slide Range up, crank Depth, switch to Power Chord, and you're in heavy rock territory. The Expression slider lets you sweep from warm jazz tone to bright country twang at any time.

**Sound physics:** Guitar = plucked string (excitation) on fretted neck (resonator) through tone circuit (modifier). Range maps to fret position, Depth to pluck force, Expression to tone circuit, Mode to right-hand technique.

## Channel 2: Bass (BAS)

**Role in the mix:** Harmonic foundation, rhythmic anchor, low-end weight.

| Control | Parameter | Left/Bottom Extreme | Center/Default | Right/Top Extreme |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Range** (knob) | Octave / string position | Sub-bass, lowest register | Mid-range, groove zone | Upper register, melodic bass |
| **Depth** (knob) | Attack force | Soft, round thump | Moderate fingerstyle | Hard, punchy slap |
| **Expression** (slider) | Drive / grit | Clean, pure tone | Slight warmth | Full overdrive, growl |
| **Mode** (spinner) | Technique | — | — | — |

**Modes (5):**
1. **Fingerstyle** — Standard two-finger plucking, even tone
2. **Pick** — Aggressive, defined attack, punk/rock energy
3. **Slap** — Thumb slap + finger pop, funk foundation
4. **Muted** — Dead notes, percussive ghost patterns
5. **Walking** — Jazz walking bass lines, stepwise melodic movement

**How they interact:** Bass at low Range + high Depth + Slap mode = deep, punchy funk slap bass. Slide Expression up for gritty rock bass tone. Switch to Walking mode and lower Depth for a smooth jazz walking line.

**Sound physics:** Bass = plucked/slapped string (excitation) on long-scale neck (resonator) through amplifier tone stack (modifier). The longer strings and lower tuning make Range shifts more dramatic than guitar.

## Channel 3: Drums (DRM)

**Role in the mix:** Rhythmic backbone, energy driver, groove definition.

| Control | Parameter | Left/Bottom Extreme | Center/Default | Right/Top Extreme |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Range** (knob) | Kit tuning / pitch | Low, boomy, loose heads | Standard tuning | High, tight, cracking |
| **Depth** (knob) | Hit intensity | Ghost notes, barely there | Moderate groove | Full-power hits |
| **Expression** (slider) | Swing / feel | Straight, mechanical, grid-locked | Slight shuffle | Heavy swing, triplet feel |
| **Mode** (spinner) | Pattern type | — | — | — |

**Modes (6):**
1. **Basic Beat** — Kick-snare-hat standard groove
2. **Half-Time** — Spacious, heavy, halved feel
3. **Double-Time** — Energetic, fast, driving
4. **Fill** — Transitional fills and rolls
5. **Breakbeat** — Syncopated, chopped, hip-hop influenced
6. **Percussion** — Hand drums, shakers, auxiliary rhythm

**How they interact:** Drums are the most "feel-oriented" instrument on the board. The Expression slider is critical — sweeping from straight to full swing transforms the entire groove character. Depth at low levels with Breakbeat mode gives you subtle, sophisticated hip-hop rhythm. Crank everything for arena-rock energy.

**Sound physics:** Drums = struck membrane/metal (excitation) on shell/body (resonator) with tuning and dampening (modifier). Range here maps to tuning rather than pitch in the melodic sense — it changes the *voice* of the kit.

**Special behavior:** Unlike melodic instruments, drums are not pitch-locked to the master key. Their Range control affects kit tone, not harmonic pitch.

## Channel 4: Piano (PNO)

**Role in the mix:** Harmonic completeness, melodic voice, rhythmic comping.

| Control | Parameter | Left/Bottom Extreme | Center/Default | Right/Top Extreme |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Range** (knob) | Register / octave | Deep bass register | Middle C territory | Sparkling treble |
| **Depth** (knob) | Key velocity | Pianissimo, delicate | Mezzo forte | Fortissimo, percussive |
| **Expression** (slider) | Sustain / damper | Full staccato, dry | Moderate ring | Washed, legato, pedal down |
| **Mode** (spinner) | Voicing style | — | — | — |

**Modes (5):**
1. **Block Chords** — Full chords, hymn-style voicing
2. **Arpeggiated** — Broken chords, flowing harp-like patterns
3. **Octaves** — Doubled octave melodies, powerful unison
4. **Shell Voicings** — Jazz root-third-seventh, open and sparse
5. **Stride** — Alternating bass note + chord, classic jazz/ragtime

**How they interact:** Piano is the most harmonically complete instrument on the board — it can fill both bass and treble roles depending on Range. At low Range + Block Chords, it anchors harmony. At high Range + Arpeggiated, it becomes a shimmering texture. Expression (sustain) is key — dry staccato chords feel rhythmic, while full sustain creates lush washes.

**Sound physics:** Piano = struck string via hammer (excitation) on soundboard (resonator) with damper pedal (modifier). It's uniquely responsive to velocity — Depth has the widest perceptual range of any instrument on the board.

## Channel 5: Strings (STR)

**Role in the mix:** Emotional depth, harmonic padding, cinematic sweep.

| Control | Parameter | Left/Bottom Extreme | Center/Default | Right/Top Extreme |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Range** (knob) | Orchestral register | Cello / contrabass | Viola / mid-range | Violin / high register |
| **Depth** (knob) | Bow pressure | Delicate, barely touching | Moderate, singing tone | Heavy, aggressive, full pressure |
| **Expression** (slider) | Vibrato / emotion | Cold, straight, precise | Warm, gentle movement | Heavy vibrato, deeply expressive |
| **Mode** (spinner) | Articulation | — | — | — |

**Modes (5):**
1. **Legato** — Smooth, connected bowing, sustained lines
2. **Staccato** — Short, detached, rhythmic bowing
3. **Pizzicato** — Plucked strings, percussive and pointed
4. **Tremolo** — Rapid bow repetition, intense and shimmering
5. **Spiccato** — Bouncing bow, light and dancing

**How they interact:** Strings are the emotional powerhouse. Low Range + high Expression + Legato mode = deep, vibrato-rich cello melody that hits you in the chest. Sweep Range up while in Tremolo mode with high Depth for cinematic tension. Pizzicato at any range adds a completely different textural element — rhythmic, plucked, almost playful.

**Sound physics:** Strings = bowed/plucked string (excitation) on resonant body (resonator) with left-hand vibrato and bowing technique (modifier). The bow is unique — it's a sustained excitation (unlike plucking), which is why strings can hold notes indefinitely and why Expression (vibrato) is so important.

**Section behavior:** The Range knob also implicitly selects the section size. Low Range activates fewer, deeper instruments (solo cello). Mid Range brings in the full section. High Range emphasizes first violins. This creates natural orchestral balance.

## Channel 6: Synth (SYN)

**Role in the mix:** Modern texture, electronic color, leads, pads, bass augmentation.

| Control | Parameter | Left/Bottom Extreme | Center/Default | Right/Top Extreme |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Range** (knob) | Pitch / octave | Sub-bass drone | Mid-range lead | Ultra-high shimmer |
| **Depth** (knob) | Filter cutoff | Dark, closed, muffled | Balanced, musical | Bright, open, full spectrum |
| **Expression** (slider) | Resonance / morphing | Subtle, clean filter | Moderate emphasis | Screaming, self-oscillating |
| **Mode** (spinner) | Waveform / character | — | — | — |

**Modes (6):**
1. **Saw** — Rich, buzzy, classic lead/pad tone
2. **Square** — Hollow, woody, retro/chiptune character
3. **Sine** — Pure, clean, sub-bass and soft pads
4. **Noise** — Textural, atmospheric, wind/breath effects
5. **Wavetable** — Complex, evolving, modern digital
6. **FM** — Bell-like, metallic, crystalline harmonics

**How they interact:** Synth is where the board gets most creative. The Depth knob on synth controls the filter, not dynamics — this is intentional because filter sweeps are THE defining gesture of synthesizer music. Combine low Range + Sine mode for sub-bass reinforcement. High Range + Saw + high Depth + high Expression for a screaming lead with resonant filter. Noise mode at any setting adds texture and atmosphere.

**Sound physics:** Synth is the only instrument on the board that doesn't model acoustic physics. Instead, it generates waveforms electronically. The controls map to synthesis parameters: oscillator pitch (Range), filter cutoff (Depth), filter resonance (Expression), and waveform selection (Mode). This is actually closer to how hardware synthesizers already work — which is why synth players will find this channel immediately intuitive.

## Channel 7: Brass (BRS)

**Role in the mix:** Power accents, melodic punch, section warmth, fanfare.

| Control | Parameter | Left/Bottom Extreme | Center/Default | Right/Top Extreme |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Range** (knob) | Register | Tuba / low brass | Mid brass / French horn | Trumpet / high brass |
| **Depth** (knob) | Breath / air force | Soft, mellow, distant | Moderate, present | Blasting, fortissimo, in-your-face |
| **Expression** (slider) | Mute position | Fully open, natural tone | Partially muted | Fully muted, wah-wah character |
| **Mode** (spinner) | Section configuration | — | — | — |

**Modes (5):**
1. **Solo Trumpet** — Single clear voice, melodic lead
2. **Horn Section** — 3-4 part harmony, R&B/soul/funk stabs
3. **Trombone** — Slide-capable, smooth jazz/big band
4. **Full Brass** — Complete orchestral brass section, powerful chords
5. **Fanfare** — Heroic, declarative, anthem-style unison

**How they interact:** Brass is about controlled power. Low Depth + Solo Trumpet + Expression (muted) = Miles Davis-style cool jazz. Crank Depth to max + Full Brass + Expression (open) = Mahler symphony climax. The Expression slider (mute position) is unique to brass — it creates the classic "wah" effect when swept during performance, which is one of the most expressive single gestures on the entire board.

**Sound physics:** Brass = forced air through vibrating lips (excitation) into metal tube (resonator) with mutes and bell flaring (modifier). The tube length (controlled by valves or slide) determines pitch; the Range knob abstracts this into register selection.

## Channel 8: Vocals (VOX)

**Role in the mix:** Human connection, emotional center, melodic top line.

| Control | Parameter | Left/Bottom Extreme | Center/Default | Right/Top Extreme |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Range** (knob) | Pitch register | Deep bass / baritone | Mid / alto-tenor | High soprano / falsetto |
| **Depth** (knob) | Breath / power | Whisper, airy | Normal singing voice | Full belt, powerful projection |
| **Expression** (slider) | Vibrato amount | Straight tone, no vibrato | Gentle natural vibrato | Heavy, operatic vibrato |
| **Mode** (spinner) | Vowel / vocal type | — | — | — |

**Modes (6):**
1. **Ooh** — Round, warm, choir pad sound
2. **Aah** — Open, bright, expressive
3. **Eeh** — Narrow, cutting, clear
4. **Humming** — Closed mouth, gentle drone
5. **Choir** — Full ensemble, multiple voices in harmony
6. **Scat** — Rhythmic, syllabic, jazz-influenced patterns

**How they interact:** Vocals are the most emotionally direct instrument. Low Depth + Humming + low Expression = distant, atmospheric background. High Depth + Aah + full Expression = powerful, vibrato-rich operatic solo. Choir mode at any setting adds immediate emotional weight. The transition between vowel modes (Ooh → Aah → Eeh) creates natural formant movement that makes the vocal channel feel alive even when the performer isn't touching Range or Depth.

**Sound physics:** Voice = air pushed through vibrating vocal folds (excitation) resonating in the throat/mouth/nasal cavity (resonator) shaped by tongue/lip position (modifier). Vowel shapes are the most uniquely human modifier — they change the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract, which is why Mode on this channel controls vowel type.

**Harmony behavior:** In Choir mode, the Range knob selects the harmony spread. Low = tight close harmony. High = wide octave-spread voicings. Depth controls how many voices are active (whisper = solo, full = 8+ voices).

## Universal Behaviors

These apply to ALL 8 instruments:

1. **Scale lock:** Range is always quantized to the master key/scale. No wrong notes.
2. **Tempo sync:** All rhythmic patterns (strum, arpeggio, drum beats, walking bass) lock to master tempo.
3. **Velocity response:** Depth affects both volume AND playing complexity (higher = more notes, more harmonics, more activity).
4. **Channel mute:** Each channel has a dedicated mute button (not shown in the 4-control layout) for dropping instruments in and out.
5. **Default position:** All controls at center = a neutral, musical, immediately-usable sound. The board should sound good with everything at noon.
