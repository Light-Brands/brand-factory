## What to Avoid

### Language to Avoid

| Don't Say | Why | Say Instead |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| "Synergistic capital solutions" | Corporate jargon | "Fair cash offers" |
| "AI-powered instant valuation engine" | Overly techy, cold | "We use modern tools to move fast" |
| "Leverage your equity" | Finance jargon | "Get cash for your home" |
| "Disrupt the market" | Startup speak | "A better way to sell" |
| "We buy ugly houses" | Condescending | "We buy homes in any condition" |
| "Act now before it's too late" | Fear-based | "Ready when you are" |

### Tone to Avoid

- **Aggressive urgency:** No countdown timers, no "last chance" language
- **Corporate coldness:** No robotic language, no form letters that feel automated
- **Fake enthusiasm:** No excessive exclamation points!!! No "We're SO excited!!!"
- **Condescension:** Never make sellers feel bad about their situation
- **Hype:** No exaggerated claims, no "revolutionary" this or "game-changing" that

### Writing Style to Avoid

- Long, complex sentences
- Industry jargon
- Passive voice when active is clearer
- Vague promises ("We might be able to help")
- Hedging language ("Perhaps you could consider...")

---

## Tech Messaging Guidelines

Cedar Capital uses technology, but it's **backstage, not front-and-center.**

### How to Talk About Technology

**Do:**
- "We use streamlined tools so you don't deal with hassle."
- "Our process is fast because we've simplified everything behind the scenes."
- "Modern systems help us give you answers quickly."

**Don't:**
- "Our AI-powered platform revolutionizes home buying!"
- "Cutting-edge algorithms determine your home's value!"
- "Blockchain-verified transactions!"

**Principle:** Tech enables the human experience — it doesn't replace it.

## Grammar & Style Notes

### Capitalization

- **Sentence case** for headlines (feels more human)
- **Cedar Capital** is always capitalized
- Avoid ALL CAPS except for very short emphasis

### Punctuation

- Use periods. Complete thoughts.
- Avoid excessive exclamation points
- Em dashes—like this—are okay for emphasis

### Numbers

- Spell out one through nine
- Use numerals for 10 and above
- Always use numerals for money ($50,000) and percentages (15%)

### Contractions

- Use them! They're human.
- "We're" not "We are"
- "Don't" not "Do not"
- "You'll" not "You will"
