# Cedar Capital Brand Voice & Messaging Guide

*How We Sound, What We Say, Why It Matters*

---

## Brand Voice Overview

Cedar Capital's voice is warm, trustworthy, and deeply personal. We speak like a trusted family friend who also happens to be an expert in real estate. Every word should reflect our core belief: **finding a home is about finding where your family belongs.**

**Cedar Capital is a guide, not a salesperson — a family ally, not just an agent.**

---

## Brand Voice Pillars

### 1. Warm & Welcoming

We speak with genuine warmth, like greeting someone at our front door. Our tone invites families in and makes them feel at ease.

**Example:** "Let's find the place where your family will make memories."
**Not:** "Browse our extensive property inventory."

**Why:** Buying a home is emotional. Families need to feel understood, not processed.

---

### 2. Trustworthy & Steady

Like a cedar tree with deep roots, our voice is grounded, reliable, and steady. We speak with quiet confidence, never hype.

**Example:** "We've been helping families in this community for three generations."
**Not:** "We're the #1 agency crushing it in the market!"

**Why:** Trust is earned through consistency, not claims. Families need to know we'll be there through every step.

---

### 3. Family-First

Everything centers on family—their dreams, their needs, their future. We think in generations, not transactions.

**Example:** "This neighborhood has excellent schools and a community that welcomes families."
**Not:** "This property offers strong investment potential and appreciation."

**Why:** Families aren't buying an asset; they're choosing where to raise their children, celebrate holidays, and build their lives.

---

### 4. Personal & Present

We remember names. We follow up after closing. We're genuinely invested in each family's story.

**Example:** "How's the move going, Sarah? Need any local recommendations?"
**Not:** "Your transaction has been completed. Please rate your experience."

**Why:** Real estate is a relationship, not a transaction. Many of our clients become lifelong friends.

---

### 5. Knowledgeable & Helpful

We share our expertise generously, helping families understand every step without overwhelming them.

**Example:** "Here's what to expect during the inspection—and I'll be there with you."
**Not:** "Inspection contingency must be exercised within 10 business days per contract terms."

**Why:** Buying a home can be confusing. We make it feel manageable and even enjoyable.

## Messaging Don'ts

### Never Use Fear or Pressure

✗ "This won't last—you need to decide today!"
✗ "The market is crazy—buy now or be priced out!"
✗ "Another family is putting in an offer..."

**Instead:** "Take the time you need. Finding the right home for your family matters more than finding a home fast."

### Never Prioritize Transaction Over Relationship

✗ "Let's get this deal closed."
✗ "Ready to pull the trigger?"
✗ "What's it going to take to get you to sign today?"

**Instead:** "How are you feeling about this home? Let's make sure it's right for your family."

### Never Be Impersonal

✗ "Dear Valued Client"
✗ "Your inquiry has been received."
✗ "Per our conversation..."

**Instead:** Use names. Remember details. Be human.

## Writing Style Rules

### Keep It Conversational

Write like you're talking to a friend over coffee. Read your copy out loud—if it sounds stiff, rewrite it.

**Stiff:** "We would be delighted to assist you in identifying a residential property that aligns with your family's requirements."

**Conversational:** "We'd love to help your family find the perfect home."

### Lead with Feeling, Follow with Features

**Standard:** "4BR/3BA, 2,400 sqft, updated kitchen, large backyard"

**Cedar Capital:** "Plenty of room for the whole family, a kitchen made for Sunday pancakes, and a backyard that's begging for a treehouse. Four bedrooms, three baths, 2,400 square feet of home."

### Use "You" and "Your Family"

Center the family in every message. It's about them, not us.

**About us:** "Cedar Capital has 35 years of experience..."
**About them:** "Your family deserves an agent with 35 years of experience..."

---

## Community Connection

Cedar Capital isn't just in the community—we're part of it. Our messaging should reflect genuine local knowledge and investment.

### Demonstrate Local Expertise

- Reference specific neighborhoods, schools, parks
- Share genuine local recommendations (not generic lists)
- Know the community stories and history
- Be present at local events

### Examples

*"The farmers market on Saturdays is where you'll meet half your neighbors. Grab coffee at Cedar Bean first."*

*"Fair warning: the July 4th block party on Maple Street is legendary. You'll want to bring your famous potato salad."*

---

## Handling Difficult Situations

### Outbid on a Home

*"I know this is really disappointing. It's hard when you can already picture your family in a place. But the right home is out there, and we'll find it together. I've got a few ideas already."*

### Market Concerns

*"The market is busy right now, and that can feel overwhelming. Here's what I want you to know: we'll find the right home for your family, and we won't rush you into the wrong one. Your family's happiness matters more than timing the market."*

### Difficult News

Lead with empathy, be honest and clear, offer support and next steps.
