# Cedar Capital Visual Identity Guidelines

*Rooted in Family, Growing Your Future*

---

## Brand Story

Cedar Capital was founded in 2025 when two families—Kelly and Joe McVeen, and Jennifer and Dan Lawless—sat around a table and asked: what if we could bring better ways of doing things to the real estate industry? With deep experience in construction methods and development processes, they saw an opportunity to help families find homes built with integrity, in communities designed to thrive.

We believe a home is more than a property—it's where families grow, memories are made, and legacies begin. Like the cedar tree that inspired our name, we stand tall through every season, providing shelter and stability for the families we serve.

We believe in generational thinking, not quarterly results. In relationships, not transactions. In community, not just commission.

## Typography

### Primary Fonts

**Playfair Display (Headings)**
Elegant, classic, and timeless—like the homes we help families find.

**Source Sans Pro (Body)**
Clean, highly readable, and approachable—communication should be clear and welcoming.

### Type Scale & Usage

**H1 — Playfair Display Bold**
36-48px | Use for: Page titles, hero statements
Example: "Where Families Find Home"

**H2 — Playfair Display SemiBold**
28-32px | Use for: Section headers, property titles
Example: "Featured Family Homes"

**H3 — Source Sans Pro SemiBold**
20-24px | Use for: Card titles, subsections
Example: "Our Family Promise"

**Body — Source Sans Pro Regular**
16-18px | Line height: 1.6
Use for: All body content, descriptions, property details

**Caption — Source Sans Pro Light**
14px | Use for: Metadata, helper text, disclaimers

### Typography Principles

- Prioritize warmth and readability
- Use generous line spacing for comfortable reading
- Headings should feel established and trustworthy
- Body text should feel conversational and clear
- Sentence case feels more personal than title case

---

## Spacing System

Based on an 8px unit for consistency:

- **4px** — Micro spacing (icon padding)
- **8px** — Tight spacing (inline elements)
- **16px** — Default spacing (form elements)
- **24px** — Comfortable spacing (card padding)
- **32px** — Section spacing (content blocks)
- **48px** — Major section breaks
- **64px** — Page-level divisions

### White Space Philosophy

Generous spacing creates a sense of calm and trust. A cluttered interface feels rushed and transactional. Our layouts should feel as open and welcoming as a family's front door.

---

## UI/UX Standards

### Corners & Shapes

- **Small elements (buttons, inputs):** 8px
