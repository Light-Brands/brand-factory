# Cedar Capital

**Rooted in Family, Growing Your Future**

---

## Overview

Cedar Capital is a warm, family-focused real estate agency built on the belief that finding a home is about finding where your family belongs. We're not in the business of selling properties—we're in the business of helping families find their place in the community.

### Our Story

Cedar Capital started around a table in 2025 when two families—Kelly and Joe McVeen, and Jennifer and Dan Lawless—came together with a shared vision: to bring better ways of doing things to the real estate industry. With backgrounds in construction methods and development processes, we saw an opportunity to build homes and communities the way they should be built—with integrity, innovation, and families at the center.

Like the cedar tree that inspired our name, we stand tall through every season, providing shelter and stability for the families we serve. We think in generations, not quarters. In relationships, not transactions. In community, not commission.
