## Overview

*The Narcissism Decoder* is a comprehensive 8-volume healing journey that guides readers from initial pattern recognition through deep recovery and beyond. This is not merely self-help literature—it is a **liberation technology** that restores sovereign perception to those who have been systematically taught to doubt their own knowing.

The series addresses narcissistic abuse across all contexts: romantic relationships, family systems, friendships, workplaces, and broader cultural dynamics. It combines clinical expertise, lived experience, and body-based wisdom to create a complete decoder system.

## Key Teachings

### The 3-3-3 Rule
A foundational tactical framework for responding in the moment:

1. **3 Seconds:** Pause before responding
2. **3 Breaths:** Engage parasympathetic nervous system (inhale 4, exhale 6)
3. **3 Words (or fewer):** Keep initial responses short

### Body-Based Recognition
The book emphasizes somatic wisdom: *"How to Recognize Control Before Your Mind Catches Up."* The body knows before the mind can articulate—learning to trust this knowing is central to recovery.

### The Decoder Cards
37 quick-reference cards organized into:
- **Core Patterns (19):** Foundational tactics—gaslighting, triangulation, love-bombing, etc.
- **Advanced Patterns (18):** Sophisticated tactics that appear during high-stakes moments
- **Emergency Protocol:** For when clarity is needed immediately
