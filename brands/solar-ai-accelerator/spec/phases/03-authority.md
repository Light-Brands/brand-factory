## The Bigger Picture

### Why We Do This

The solar industry has the potential to be a force for tremendous good—accelerating the transition to clean energy, creating meaningful employment, and empowering homeowners with energy independence.

But like any industry, it can go either way. It can be driven by the right motivations or the wrong ones.

Phase 3 exists to amplify organizations that are doing it right. Organizations that:
- Treat customers fairly
- Take care of their teams
- Operate with integrity
- Consider environmental impact beyond just selling solar
- Think long-term about their legacy

These organizations deserve authority. They deserve to shape the industry. They deserve to be recognized and amplified.

That's what Phase 3 is for.

### The Ripple Effect

When values-aligned organizations gain authority:
- Industry standards rise
- Bad actors get marginalized
- Customer trust increases
- Employee experiences improve
- Environmental impact multiplies
- The whole industry benefits

One organization with authority can influence hundreds of others.
That influence can shift an entire industry.
That industry shift can affect the planet.

This is why Phase 3 matters. This is why we're selective. This is why it's by invitation only.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is Phase 3 invitation-only?

Authority is powerful. We only want to amplify organizations that will use that authority responsibly and for good. The invitation-only process ensures values alignment.

### What if we're declined?

A "Not Yet" decision isn't permanent. If specific criteria aren't met, we'll share what would need to change. Organizations can re-apply after addressing those areas.

### Can we do Phase 3 without Phases 1 and 2?

No. The phases build on each other. Phase 1 creates the strategy, Phase 2 creates the operational foundation, and Phase 3 builds authority on top of that foundation. Each phase is required.

### How long does Phase 3 last?

Phase 3 is an ongoing partnership. The initial engagement is typically 12 months, with renewal based on mutual benefit and continued alignment.

### What's the council?

The council is a group of advisors who evaluate Phase 3 applicants. They assess values alignment, track record, and commitment to positive impact. Their decision is final.

### What if our values drift?

Continued Phase 3 participation requires continued values alignment. If an organization's behavior diverges from stated values, the partnership may be paused or ended.

## Expression of Interest

If you've completed Phase 2 and believe you may be aligned for Phase 3, let us know. We'll share more about the application process and help you understand the requirements.

Not every organization is right for Phase 3—and that's okay. Phases 1 and 2 deliver tremendous value on their own.

But for those who are ready to lead their industry with integrity, Phase 3 is the next step.

*Phase 3 is for those who want to build something that lasts—and that matters.*
