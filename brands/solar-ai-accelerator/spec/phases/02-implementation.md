# Phase 2: Implementation

> *Build & deploy your AI-powered sales pipeline.*

---

## Overview

Phase 2 transforms the Phase 1 master plan into a fully operational system. The scope, timeline, and investment are determined by Phase 1 findings—every implementation is customized to the specific needs, priorities, and budget of the organization.

---

## Implementation Options

### Option A: Full Build
**Best for:** Organizations with budget and urgency
**Approach:** All components implemented simultaneously
**Timeline:** 8-16 weeks
**Trade-offs:** Highest upfront investment, fastest time to full value

### Option B: Phased Rollout
**Best for:** Budget-conscious or risk-averse organizations
**Approach:** Components deployed in priority order
**Timeline:** 16-24 weeks for full scope
**Trade-offs:** Spreads investment, each phase delivers standalone value

### Option C: Core First
**Best for:** Organizations wanting to prove ROI before expanding
**Approach:** Essential components first, AI enhancements later
**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks for core, ongoing for enhancements
**Trade-offs:** Lowest initial investment, slower to full capability
