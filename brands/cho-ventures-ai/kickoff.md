## 1. Introductions & Goals Alignment

Tony, before we dive into the details -- I want to make sure I understand what would make this engagement a home run for you.

When this is done and you're looking at the deliverables, what do you want to be able to do that you can't do today?

Is there a specific problem that's been nagging you, or is this more about finding opportunities you haven't seen yet?

Who else on your team will care about the output of this? Who are we ultimately serving here besides yourself?

## 2. Current State Overview -- Systems, Tools & Stack

I want to get a full picture of what you're running right now. We've already started the ecosystem map with Amy -- this is where we fill in the gaps and confirm what we have.

Walk me through a typical day at Cho Ventures -- what tools does your team open first thing in the morning?

What's your CRM situation? How are you tracking deals, portfolio companies, relationships?

Where does your data actually live? Spreadsheets, databases, SaaS platforms?

What communication tools are you using -- Slack, email, something else? Where do decisions get made vs. where do they get discussed?

Any tools you're paying for but barely using? Anything you've outgrown?

**Checklist -- confirm or discover:**
- [ ] CRM / deal tracking
- [ ] Communication (email, chat, meetings)
- [ ] Document management / storage
- [ ] Financial tools / accounting
- [ ] Portfolio monitoring / reporting
- [ ] Marketing / outreach tools
- [ ] Project management
- [ ] Data / analytics platforms
- [ ] Custom-built tools or scripts
- [ ] Third-party integrations already in place

## 3. Key Business Processes Deep-Dive

I want to understand the workflows, not just the tools. Where does time go? Where are the bottlenecks? That's where the AI opportunities hide.

What are the 3-5 core processes that keep Cho Ventures running?

Walk me through your deal flow -- from first hearing about an opportunity to making a decision.

What's the most repetitive thing your team does every week?

Where do things slow down or get stuck? Where are the handoffs that drop the ball?

If you could clone one person on your team to handle their workload, who would it be and what would the clone do?

**Processes to map:**
- [ ] Deal sourcing & evaluation
- [ ] Due diligence workflow
- [ ] Portfolio company support / check-ins
- [ ] Investor relations / reporting
- [ ] Internal decision-making process
- [ ] Content / thought leadership pipeline
- [ ] Administrative / back-office operations

## 4. Areas of Interest -- Where You See AI Potential

I'd love to hear where you think AI fits in. This helps me understand your priorities and where your head's at.

Where have you already experimented with AI, even informally? ChatGPT, copilots, anything?

What triggered this engagement -- was there a specific moment where you thought "AI could help here"?

Are there things your competitors or peers are doing with AI that caught your attention?

What would you NOT want AI touching in your business?

If AI could solve one problem for you tomorrow, what would it be?

## 5. Data & Access Requirements

For us to map everything accurately, we need to see how your systems connect. Let me walk you through what we'll need.

What's the easiest way to get us visibility into your platforms?

Are there any systems where access is restricted or would need approval from someone else?

Do you have any existing documentation -- process docs, org charts, system diagrams -- even rough ones?

Any data sensitivity concerns we should be aware of? Investor data, proprietary deal info, etc.

**What we'll need from you:**
- [ ] Tool/platform list with login info or screenshots
- [ ] Org chart or team structure
- [ ] Any existing process documentation
- [ ] API documentation for key systems (if applicable)
- [ ] Sample workflows or SOPs
- [ ] Your sign-off to access relevant accounts

## 6. Deliverables Walkthrough

Let me walk you through exactly what you're getting so we're on the same page. If anything doesn't match what you actually want, now's the time to adjust.

### Ecosystem Map (in progress with Amy)
This is a visual documentation of your current systems, workflows, and data flows. We've already started building this out -- I'll share a draft for your review as we go.

### AI Opportunity Matrix
This is the full inventory of potential AI applications with feasibility and impact ratings. Think of it as the menu of everything you could build. We score each one so you're not guessing.

### Connection Architecture
This shows how your systems link together -- data dependencies, integration requirements. It tells us where AI can actually plug in vs. where we'd need to build bridges first.

### Priority Recommendation
This is the single best starting point, with timeline, resources, and success metrics. The "start here" -- one project that delivers value fast and sets up the next thing.

### Findings Presentation
We'll walk through everything together live, answer questions, and plan next steps.

## 7. Timeline & Communication Cadence

Let's lock in how we work together over the next 2-3 weeks.

How do you prefer to communicate during the project -- email, Slack, quick calls?

Would you want a mid-point check-in, or do you prefer we come back with the finished product?

Are there any dates or deadlines on your end we should be aware of?

Who's our day-to-day contact if we have quick questions?
