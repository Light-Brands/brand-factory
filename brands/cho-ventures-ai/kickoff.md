## 1. Introductions & Goals Alignment

**Goal:** Get Tony talking about what he actually wants out of this -- not what he thinks we want to hear. Understand what success looks like in his words.

**Guide the conversation:**
- "Before we dive into the details -- what would make this engagement a home run for you?"
- "When this is done and you're looking at the deliverables, what do you want to be able to do that you can't do today?"
- "Is there a specific problem that's been nagging you, or is this more about finding opportunities you haven't seen yet?"
- "Who else on your team will care about the output of this? Who are we ultimately serving here?"

## 2. Current State Overview -- Systems, Tools & Stack

**Goal:** Get a full inventory of what they're running. We've started the ecosystem map with Amy -- this is where we fill in the gaps and confirm what we have.

**Guide the conversation:**
- "Walk me through a typical day at Cho Ventures -- what tools does your team open first thing in the morning?"
- "What's your CRM situation? How are you tracking deals, portfolio companies, relationships?"
- "Where does your data actually live? Spreadsheets, databases, SaaS platforms?"
- "What communication tools -- Slack, email, something else? Where do decisions get made vs. where do they get discussed?"
- "Any tools you're paying for but barely using? Anything you've outgrown?"

**Checklist -- confirm or discover:**
- [ ] CRM / deal tracking
- [ ] Communication (email, chat, meetings)
- [ ] Document management / storage
- [ ] Financial tools / accounting
- [ ] Portfolio monitoring / reporting
- [ ] Marketing / outreach tools
- [ ] Project management
- [ ] Data / analytics platforms
- [ ] Custom-built tools or scripts
- [ ] Third-party integrations already in place

## 3. Key Business Processes Deep-Dive

**Goal:** Understand the workflows, not just the tools. Where does time go? Where are the bottlenecks? This is where AI opportunities hide.

**Guide the conversation:**
- "What are the 3-5 core processes that keep Cho Ventures running?"
- "Walk me through your deal flow -- from first hearing about an opportunity to making a decision."
- "What's the most repetitive thing your team does every week?"
- "Where do things slow down or get stuck? Where are the handoffs that drop the ball?"
- "If you could clone one person on your team to handle their workload, who would it be and what would the clone do?"

**Processes to map:**
- [ ] Deal sourcing & evaluation
- [ ] Due diligence workflow
- [ ] Portfolio company support / check-ins
- [ ] Investor relations / reporting
- [ ] Internal decision-making process
- [ ] Content / thought leadership pipeline
- [ ] Administrative / back-office operations

## 4. Areas of Interest -- Where Tony Sees AI Potential

**Goal:** Let Tony tell us where he thinks AI fits. This reveals priorities, expectations, and whether he's thinking too small or too big. Both are useful signals.

**Guide the conversation:**
- "Where have you already experimented with AI, even informally? ChatGPT, copilots, anything?"
- "What triggered this engagement -- was there a specific moment where you thought 'AI could help here'?"
- "Are there things your competitors or peers are doing with AI that caught your attention?"
- "What would you NOT want AI touching in your business?"
- "If AI could solve one problem for you tomorrow, what would it be?"

## 5. Data & Access Requirements

**Goal:** Figure out exactly what we need access to in order to complete the ecosystem map and build the opportunity matrix. Get commitments and timelines for access.

**Guide the conversation:**
- "For us to map everything accurately, we'll need to see how your systems connect. What's the easiest way to get us visibility?"
- "Are there any systems where access is restricted or would need approval from someone else?"
- "Do you have any existing documentation -- process docs, org charts, system diagrams -- even rough ones?"
- "Any data sensitivity concerns we should be aware of? Investor data, proprietary deal info, etc."

**Access needed:**
- [ ] Tool/platform list with login info or screenshots
- [ ] Org chart or team structure
- [ ] Any existing process documentation
- [ ] API documentation for key systems (if applicable)
- [ ] Sample workflows or SOPs
- [ ] Permission from Tony to access relevant accounts

## 6. Deliverables Walkthrough

**Goal:** Set clear expectations on what each deliverable looks like and confirm it matches what Tony actually wants. Adjust scope now, not later.

**Walk through each:**

### Ecosystem Map (in progress with Amy)
- Visual documentation of current systems, workflows, and data flows
- "We've already started building this out -- we'll share a draft for your review as we go."

### AI Opportunity Matrix
- Full inventory of potential AI applications with feasibility and impact ratings
- "This is the menu of everything you could build. We score each one so you're not guessing."

### Connection Architecture
- How systems link together, data dependencies, integration requirements
- "This shows us where AI can actually plug in vs. where we'd need to build bridges first."

### Priority Recommendation
- The single best starting point with timeline, resources, and success metrics
- "This is the 'start here' -- one project that delivers value fast and sets up the next thing."

### Findings Presentation
- Live walkthrough with Q&A and strategic discussion
- "We'll walk through everything together, answer questions, and plan next steps."

## 7. Timeline & Communication Cadence

**Goal:** Lock in how we work together over the next 2-3 weeks. Set expectations on check-ins and turnaround.

**Guide the conversation:**
- "How do you prefer to communicate during the project -- email, Slack, quick calls?"
- "Would you want a mid-point check-in, or do you prefer we come back with the finished product?"
- "Are there any dates or deadlines on your end we should be aware of?"
- "Who's our day-to-day contact if we have quick questions?"
