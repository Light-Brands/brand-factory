Hi Tony,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out ahead of today's call to let you know that we'll need to postpone the kickoff until the outstanding payment is settled.

As you know, we've put considerable effort into preparing for this engagement, the ecosystem mapping with Amy, the full diagnostic framework, your kickoff agenda, and the broader strategic planning around the partnership. We've treated this project as a priority and have been building toward today's session for some time.

That said, beginning active project work before the financials are squared away isn't something we're in a position to do. It's a standard practice on our end and one that ensures both sides are fully committed going in.

We're genuinely excited about this project and the potential here. Nothing has changed on that front. If you're able to get the payment taken care of before the scheduled call, we're happy to proceed as planned. Otherwise, we can reschedule for whenever works once it's resolved.

Feel free to reach out whenever you're ready to move forward, we'll pick right back up.

Best,
Dan Lawless
