# Cho Ventures: Raise-to-Build Partnership Strategy

> *A strategic framework for aligning capital formation with full-stack development partnership*

---

## Executive Summary

Tony Cho is raising **$11M** for the Cho Ventures ecosystem. This document outlines a strategic engagement model where Light Brands:

1. **Provides value** by introducing Cho Ventures to our network of qualified fundraisers
2. **Secures commitment** as the exclusive digital development and app partner
3. **Ensures alignment** by entering the engagement after capital is secured
4. **Achieves wholeness** through a properly scoped full-development engagement

**The Core Proposition:** We help you raise → We build what you raise for.

---

## Part 1: Understanding the $11M Raise

### Key Questions to Clarify

Before proceeding, we need clarity on the capital structure:

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **What is the $11M for?** | Determines how much flows to digital infrastructure |
| **Is this equity, debt, or mixed?** | Impacts investor expectations and use of funds |
| **What's the timeline?** | Determines when development could begin |
| **What's already committed vs. to raise?** | Validates readiness for partnership |
| **Is there a designated tech/digital allocation?** | Confirms budget for development scope |

### Likely Capital Allocation Framework

Based on our discovery of the Cho Ventures ecosystem, here's how $11M might typically be allocated for a portfolio of this nature:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   HYPOTHETICAL $11M ALLOCATION                          │

│   ──────────────────────────         ────────────────────                │
│   • PHX-JAX Development: $4-6M      • Unified Hub/CRM: $150-250K        │
│   • Climate HUB Build-out: $1-2M    • Community App: $200-350K          │
│   • ChoZen Improvements: $500K-1M   • AI Layer: $100-200K               │
│                                     • Authority Platform: $150-250K     │
│   Real Estate Subtotal: $5.5-9M     Digital Subtotal: $600K-$1.05M     │
│                                                                          │
│   OPERATIONS / OVERHEAD             RESERVES / CONTINGENCY              │
│   ─────────────────────             ──────────────────────              │
│   • Team Expansion: $300-500K       • Operating Reserve: $500K-1M       │
│   • Marketing/PR: $200-400K         • Contingency: $300-500K            │
│   • Legal/Compliance: $100-200K                                         │
│   Operations Subtotal: $600K-1.1M   Reserves Subtotal: $800K-1.5M      │
│                                                                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Target Digital Allocation: $600K - $1.05M

This range aligns with our full ecosystem development scope:
- **Minimum viable engagement:** $600K covers Phase 2 + core Phase 3
- **Optimal engagement:** $1M+ enables complete transformation including training

### Why This Model Works

**For Cho Ventures:**
- Access to qualified investor relationships they wouldn't otherwise have
- Development partner who is invested in fundraising success
- Aligned incentives (we succeed when they succeed)
- No upfront capital required until raise closes

**For Light Brands:**
- Guaranteed meaningful engagement (no $5K discovery that leads nowhere)
- Development scope that justifies deep investment of attention
- Client who has capital to execute properly
- Reference project with significant portfolio visibility

---

## Part 3: Engagement Structure Options

### Option A: Success Fee + Development Contract (Recommended)

**Structure:**
- Light Brands provides fundraising introductions and support
- Upon successful close of raise (or portion thereof), Light Brands is engaged as development partner
- Development contract is pre-negotiated and contingent on capital

**Terms:**
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Success Fee | 2-3% of capital raised through LB introductions |
| Development Commitment | Minimum $600K, up to $1M+ based on allocation |
| Exclusivity | LB is sole digital/app development partner |
| Timeline Trigger | Development begins within 60 days of raise close |

**Example Scenario:**
- LB introduces investors who commit $3M of the $11M raise
- Success fee: $60K-$90K (2-3% of $3M)
- Development contract: $750K (locked in upon close)
- Total LB engagement value: $810K-$840K

---

### Option B: Sweat Equity + Reduced Cash Development

**Structure:**
- Light Brands provides strategic and fundraising support pre-raise
- Receives equity stake in Cho Ventures or specific entity
- Development fees are reduced in exchange for equity upside

**Terms:**
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Equity Stake | 1-3% of Cho Ventures (or specific entity like ChoZen) |
| Cash Development Fee | 50-70% of standard rates ($300K-$500K) |
| Vesting | Equity vests over 2-3 years of partnership |
| Anti-Dilution | Standard protection through next round |

**Example Scenario:**
- LB receives 2% equity in ChoZen entity (valued at $200K-$500K at maturity)
- Development contract: $450K (60% of $750K standard)
- Total LB engagement value: $650K-$950K (with upside potential)

---

### Option C: Deferred Development + Revenue Share

**Structure:**
- Light Brands begins development immediately at reduced rates
- Balance is paid through revenue share from developed platforms
- Aligns long-term success with ongoing partnership

**Terms:**
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Upfront Development Fee | $300K (40% of standard scope) |
| Revenue Share | 5-10% of platform revenue for 3 years |
| Platforms Covered | Community app, course platform, booking systems |
| Cap on Revenue Share | 2x original development value ($600K cap) |

**Example Scenario:**
- Upfront: $300K development fee
- Year 1 Revenue Share: $50K (course + community + bookings)
- Year 2 Revenue Share: $100K (scaled platforms)
- Year 3 Revenue Share: $150K (mature ecosystem)
- Total LB value: $600K over 3 years (with potential for cap at $600K)

---

### Option D: Pure Development Partnership (Post-Raise)

**Structure:**
- No fundraising involvement from Light Brands
- Standard development engagement after capital is secured
- Premium rates for full scope commitment

**Terms:**
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Development Scope | Full Phase 2 + Phase 3 |
| Investment | $650K-$850K (Authority Package pricing) |
| Exclusivity | LB is sole digital/app development partner |
| Timeline | 6-9 months from contract execution |

**Why This Works:**
- Clear boundaries (we build, they raise)
- No success fee complexity
- Full-rate engagement with premium positioning
- Simple contract structure

---

## Part 6: Decision Framework

### Questions for Tony Cho

Before finalizing this partnership approach, we need answers to:

1. **Capital Allocation:**
   - What percentage of the $11M is designated for digital/technology infrastructure?
   - Is this a hard allocation or flexible based on priorities?

2. **Fundraising Status:**
   - How much of the $11M is already committed vs. being raised?
   - What's the target close timeline?
   - Are there specific investor profiles you're seeking?

3. **Development Priorities:**
   - Which platforms are highest priority (CRM hub, community app, course platform)?
   - Is there flexibility on sequencing based on capital timing?

4. **Partnership Appetite:**
   - Is the equity/sweat model appealing or strictly cash engagement?
   - How do you view the success fee structure for fundraising support?

5. **Exclusivity:**
   - Are you currently working with other development partners?
   - Would exclusivity be acceptable in exchange for fundraising support?

### Decision Matrix

| If Tony says... | Recommended Path |
|-----------------|------------------|
| "Digital allocation is $500K+" | **Option A or D** - Full development engagement |
| "We need fundraising help first" | **Option A** - Success fee + development |
| "We're open to equity arrangements" | **Option B** - Sweat equity model |
| "Cash is tight but we want to start" | **Option C** - Deferred + revenue share |
| "We just need a development quote" | **Option D** - Standard post-raise engagement |

## Part 8: Risk Mitigation

### Protecting Light Brands

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Raise doesn't close | Development contract is contingent; no work begins without capital |
| Scope creep | Fixed-scope contract with change order process |
| Payment delays | Milestone-based payments with work-stop provisions |
| Relationship attribution disputes | Clear tracking of introductions from day one |

### Protecting Cho Ventures

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Development delays | Milestone-based delivery with accountability |
| Quality concerns | Defined acceptance criteria and revision process |
| Cost overruns | Fixed-price engagement (not hourly) |
| Network access without results | Success fee only on closed capital |

## Conclusion

The Raise-to-Build model aligns both parties toward mutual success:

- **Cho Ventures** gets access to capital relationships and a committed development partner
- **Light Brands** gets a properly scoped engagement that justifies deep commitment

**The key principle:** We don't do piecemeal. If we're helping raise capital for this ecosystem, we're building this ecosystem.

This ensures both parties feel "whole" - Cho Ventures gets the full infrastructure they need, and Light Brands gets the meaningful engagement that makes the partnership worthwhile.
