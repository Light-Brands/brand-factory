## Overview

This document presents creative alternatives to the standard fixed-fee engagement, exploring partnership structures that align Light Brands' success with Cho Ventures' long-term outcomes. These models offer potential benefits for both parties: reduced upfront capital requirements for Cho Ventures and upside participation for Light Brands.

## Scenario 1: Hybrid Cash + Equity (Reduced Upfront)

**Structure:** 60% Cash / 40% Equity Value

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Cash Investment | $270,000 |
| Equity Value | $180,000 |
| **Total Value** | **$450,000** |

### Equity Allocation

The $180,000 equity component could be structured as:

| Option | Vehicle | Equity % | Vesting |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| **A** | ChoZen Community Platform (if spun out) | 5-8% | Over deliverable milestones |
| **B** | Cho Ventures Holding Company | 0.5-1% | Over 24 months |
| **C** | Future Revenue Share | 3% of new revenue streams | 36-month term |

### Cash Payment Schedule (Reduced)

| Milestone | Amount | Timing |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Phase 0+1 Kickoff | $28,000 | Upon signing |
| Phase 2 Kickoff | $48,000 | Week 2 |
| Phase 2 Midpoint | $36,000 | Month 2 |
| Phase 2 Completion | $36,000 | Month 3 |
| Phase 3 Kickoff | $48,000 | Month 3 |
| Phase 3 Midpoint | $36,000 | Month 4 |
| Phase 3 Completion | $38,000 | Month 5 |
| **Cash Total** | **$270,000** | |

### Equity Vesting Triggers

| Deliverable | Equity Vested | Cumulative |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Phase 2 Complete (Platform Live) | 40% | 40% |
| Phase 3 Complete (Authority Platform Live) | 30% | 70% |
| 6-Month Performance Review (KPIs Met) | 20% | 90% |
| 12-Month Anniversary | 10% | 100% |

**Why This Works:**
- Cho Ventures: $180K less upfront capital required
- Light Brands: Aligned with long-term success, potential upside

## Scenario 2: Milestone-Based Equity Conversion

**Structure:** Full cash with equity conversion rights

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Base Cash | $450,000 (standard pricing) |
| Equity Option | Right to convert up to $100K into equity at pre-agreed valuation |

### How It Works

1. Light Brands completes work at standard $450K cash pricing
2. At project completion, Light Brands may elect to convert up to $100K of final payments into equity
3. Conversion happens at a pre-negotiated valuation cap

### Conversion Terms

| Parameter | Terms |
|-----------|-------|
| Conversion Window | 30 days post-Phase 3 completion |
| Maximum Conversion | $100,000 |
| Valuation Cap | $5M (ChoZen) or $50M (Cho Ventures) |
| Equity Type | Common units or SAFE |
| Cliff | None (immediate vesting upon conversion) |

### Example Scenarios

**If Light Brands converts $100K into ChoZen equity:**
- At $5M valuation cap → 2% equity
- If ChoZen grows to $20M valuation → $400K value (4x)
- If ChoZen grows to $50M valuation → $1M value (10x)

**Why This Works:**
- Cho Ventures: Full cash received, no dilution unless Light Brands performs
- Light Brands: Option (not obligation) to participate in upside

## Scenario 3: Revenue Share Partnership

**Structure:** Reduced cash + revenue participation

| Component | Amount/Terms |
|-----------|--------------|
| Cash Investment | $300,000 (67% of standard) |
| Revenue Share | 5% of new revenue streams for 36 months |
| **Cap** | $300,000 maximum revenue share |

### Revenue Streams Included

| Stream | Projected Annual | 5% Share |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Online Course Revenue | $350,000 | $17,500 |
| Community Subscriptions | $250,000 | $12,500 |
| ChoZen Retreat Increase | $400,000 | $20,000 |
| Speaking Revenue | $100,000 | $5,000 |
| **Annual Total** | **$1,100,000** | **$55,000** |

### 36-Month Projection

| Year | Estimated Revenue | 5% Share | Cumulative |
|------|-------------------|----------|------------|
| Year 1 | $1,100,000 | $55,000 | $55,000 |
| Year 2 | $1,800,000 | $90,000 | $145,000 |
| Year 3 | $2,500,000 | $125,000 | $270,000 |

*Note: Revenue share capped at $300,000 total*

### Cash Payment Schedule (Reduced)

| Milestone | Amount | Timing |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Phase 0+1 Kickoff | $28,000 | Upon signing |
| Phase 2 (3 payments) | $120,000 | Months 1-3 |
| Phase 3 (3 payments) | $122,000 | Months 3-5 |
| Phase 4 Training | $30,000 | Month 5-6 |
| **Cash Total** | **$300,000** | |

**Why This Works:**
- Cho Ventures: $150K less upfront, payments tied to success
- Light Brands: Ongoing relationship, aligned incentives, potential upside

## Scenario 4: Deferred Payment with Success Bonus

**Structure:** Stretched payments + performance bonus

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Base Investment | $400,000 (cash, extended timeline) |
| Success Bonus Pool | $100,000 (tied to KPIs) |
| **Maximum Total** | **$500,000** |

### Extended Payment Schedule

| Milestone | Amount | Timing |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Phase 0+1 Kickoff | $28,000 | Upon signing |
| Phase 2 Start | $50,000 | Month 1 |
| Phase 2 Midpoint | $50,000 | Month 2 |
| Phase 2 Complete | $50,000 | Month 3 |
| Phase 3 Start | $50,000 | Month 3 |
| Phase 3 Midpoint | $50,000 | Month 4 |
| Phase 3 Complete | $50,000 | Month 5 |

| Month 9 | $14,000 | Month 9 |
| Month 12 | $14,000 | Month 12 |
| Month 15 | $14,000 | Month 15 |
| **Base Total** | **$400,000** | |

### Success Bonus Triggers

| KPI | Target | Bonus |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Community Members (12 mo) | 2,500+ active | $25,000 |
| Course Revenue (12 mo) | $200K+ | $25,000 |
| Lead Response Time | <1 hour avg | $15,000 |
| Cross-Entity Referrals | 100+ tracked | $20,000 |
| Platform Uptime | 99.5%+ | $15,000 |
| **Maximum Bonus** | | **$100,000** |

**Why This Works:**
- Cho Ventures: Lower monthly payments, only pays bonus if KPIs hit
- Light Brands: Potential to earn $50K more than standard engagement

## Scenario 5: Joint Venture (ChoZen Platform)

**Structure:** Co-ownership of the community platform

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Cash Investment | $250,000 (for Phases 0-2, 3D, 3E, 4) |
| JV Contribution | Light Brands builds ChoZen platform (Phase 2C, 3B, 3C) as equity |
| **Light Brands Ownership** | 15-20% of ChoZen entity |

### What Each Party Contributes

**Cho Ventures Contributes:**
- Brand, audience, and Tony Cho's platform
- Initial community and retreat guests
- Content (book, courses, speaking)
- Ongoing operations and community management
- Cash: $250,000 for non-ChoZen components

**Light Brands Contributes:**
- Technical build of ChoZen platform ($162,000 value)
- Ongoing technical support and evolution
- AI capabilities and integrations

### Economics

| Metric | Cho Ventures (80-85%) | Light Brands (15-20%) |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Year 1 Revenue ($500K) | $400-425K | $75-100K |
| Year 2 Revenue ($1.2M) | $960K-1.02M | $180-240K |
| Year 3 Revenue ($2.5M) | $2-2.125M | $375-500K |

### Exit Scenarios

| Event | Light Brands Outcome |
|-------|---------------------|
| ChoZen acquired at $10M | $1.5-2M payout |
| ChoZen acquired at $25M | $3.75-5M payout |
| ChoZen IPO/major round | Proportional participation |
| Buyout option | Cho Ventures can buy out at 3x revenue multiple after Year 3 |

**Why This Works:**
- Cho Ventures: $200K less upfront, expert technical partner with skin in game
- Light Brands: Ownership in high-potential community platform

## Comparison Matrix

| Scenario | Upfront Cash | Total Cash | Equity/Upside | Risk Level | Best For |
|----------|--------------|------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| **Standard** | $450K | $450K | None | Low | Certainty |
| **1: Hybrid** | $270K | $270K | $180K equity | Medium | Cash conservation |

| **5: JV** | $250K | $250K | 15-20% ownership | High | Maximum alignment |

## Recommended Approach

Based on the strategic nature of this engagement and the potential of the ChoZen platform, we suggest exploring a combination:

### Proposed Hybrid Structure

| Component | Amount | Structure |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Phases 0, 1, 4 | $58,000 | Cash (standard) |
| Phase 2 | $195,000 | Cash (standard) |
| Phase 3 | $147,000 | Cash (75% of standard) |
| Phase 3 Equity | $50,000 | Equity in ChoZen at $2.5M cap |
| **Total** | **$450,000** | $400K cash + $50K equity |

This structure:
- Maintains strong cash payments for build phases
- Introduces equity alignment specifically for the Authority Platform (Phase 3)
- Values ChoZen platform at early-stage valuation
- Gives Light Brands ~2% stake with upside potential

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review scenarios** and identify which structure(s) resonate
2. **Discuss valuation** parameters for equity components
3. **Define KPIs** for any performance-based structures
4. **Legal review** of preferred structure
5. **Draft partnership agreement** with selected terms

---

## Legal Considerations

Any equity or partnership structure would require:

- [ ] Formal valuation of relevant entity/entities
- [ ] Operating agreement amendments (if LLC)
- [ ] SAFE or equity grant documentation
- [ ] Vesting agreement with acceleration clauses
- [ ] Right of first refusal / tag-along provisions
- [ ] Non-compete and IP assignment clarity
- [ ] Tax implications review for both parties
