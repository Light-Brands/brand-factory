**Official Publication Date:** August 11, 2026  
**Launch Timeline:** View Launch Timeline (Password: regen)

### Campaign Objective

### Official Book Blurb

**Step into the world of Regenerative Placemaking**

In an era where concrete dominates and nature feels distant, regenerative placemaking is a movement transforming our cities and rekindling our connection to what truly matters. Generation Regeneration shows us how to rebuild balance between people, communities, and the planet.

Drawing from decades of lived experience, impact entrepreneur and visionary real estate developer Tony Cho introduces you to regenerative placemaking—a transformative approach that moves beyond sustainability toward systems that actively heal, uplift, and regenerate. Through this lens, cities become living ecosystems where community, nature, and culture work in harmony to create abundance for all.

This book equips policymakers, developers, cultural builders, and everyday citizens with the tools to reimagine urban life. You'll explore the three pillars of regenerative placemaking and learn how they can cultivate economic vitality, deepen human connection, and foster environments that nourish both people and the planet. Through real stories from pioneers on the front lines, you will discover that a regenerative future isn't just possible—it's already emerging.

Generation Regeneration is an invitation to become a co-creator of thriving, life-affirming cities for generations to come. Join the movement to help shape a world where humanity and nature flourish together.

### Key Talking Points

#### 1) The "loneliness epidemic" is a design problem—and real estate helped create it

**Core idea:** Profit-driven, car-centric, isolating development patterns have eroded social fabric: we're physically closer, but emotionally and civically disconnected (stress, isolation, weaker resilience).

**Why it matters:** Buildings don't just shape skylines—they shape wellbeing and whether communities can actually thrive together.

**Benchmark alignment (Food Fix):** Same "this crisis isn't accidental—it's a system" framing + urgency-driven wake-up call.

**Regenerative Placemaking is a blueprint: treat cities like living ecosystems**

**Core idea:** Move beyond "sustainable" (less harm) to regenerative (actively heal)—uplifting people, communities, and the planet through a systems lens.

**The organizing framework:** Community + Nature + Culture working in harmony as the three pillars that drive belonging, vitality, and environments that nourish humans and ecosystems.

#### 3) Regeneration is wellness—there is no wellness without regeneration

**Core idea:** Personal and community wellbeing isn't something you "add on" after development; it's the direct outcome of whether a place regenerates life—socially, ecologically, and culturally. When cities are designed for extraction and isolation, wellness declines. When they're designed to restore ecosystems and strengthen belonging, wellness becomes the default.
