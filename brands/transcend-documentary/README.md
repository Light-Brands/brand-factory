## Vision

A man rescued from the brink of suicide receives a mandate to "bring the lost travelers home." In obeying it, he walks alongside others as they confront what they've been running from — revealing how healing happens when people are held in the right place, at the right time, with the right care.

## What This Is

**Bringing the Lost Traveler Back Home** is a cinematic, multi-episode documentary series.

- Each episode follows one individual at a moment of inner reckoning
- Stories contribute to a larger journey of return
- This is not a story about substances — it is a story about people
- A story about the places that help them come home to themselves

## Core Principles

1. **Medicine is contextual, never central** — The focus is on human transformation
2. **Integration over intervention** — Healing is a return, not a quick fix
3. **The container matters** — Transcend is revealed through care, not explanation
4. **Dual-purpose content** — Each episode serves the series and the individual's legacy
5. **Partnership over approval** — This is about stewarding meaningful work

## The Place

Every journey in this series passes through **Transcend Clinic** — a place where:

- People are received with seriousness
- Ancient intelligence is approached with modern care
- Healing is not rushed, promised, or commodified
- Confrontation leads to return, not fragmentation
