## Series Philosophy

The Sovereignty Series operates on several core principles:

1. **Body First:** The nervous system knows before the mind
2. **No Diagnosis Required:** You don't need a label to protect yourself
3. **Both/And:** Recognition AND compassion can coexist
4. **Sovereignty:** Your perception is valid—reclaim it
5. **Service:** Healed people heal people

---

## The Destination: Sovereignty

What does sovereignty look like?

- **Trusting your own perception** without external validation
- **Setting boundaries** as acts of love, not walls of fear
- **Connecting authentically** with discernment, not hypervigilance
- **Speaking your truth** without apology or aggression
- **Living your purpose** free from manipulation patterns
- **Serving others** from overflow, not depletion

*"The confusion ends here. Sovereignty begins now."*
