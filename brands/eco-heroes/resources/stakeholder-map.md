## Conflict Resolution Between Stakeholders

When stakeholder interests conflict:

1. **Return to mission** — Which choice best serves core purpose?
2. **Prioritize the voiceless** — Earth and future generations don't have lobbyists
3. **Seek integration** — Can both needs be met creatively?
4. **Be transparent** — Explain tradeoffs openly
5. **Consult Council** — For significant conflicts

**Priority Order (when integration fails):**
1. Mission and principles
2. Earth and future generations
3. Participants and communities served
4. Cultural and indigenous partners
5. All other stakeholders
