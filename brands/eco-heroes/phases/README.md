## Overview

Eco Heroes implementation unfolds through four major phases, each building on the previous. This is not a race — it's a cultivation. Each phase must be completed with integrity before proceeding.

## Risk Checkpoints

At each phase transition, assess:

1. **Mission Drift:** Are we still aligned with original purpose?
2. **Cultural Integrity:** Are indigenous partnerships genuine?
3. **Economic Health:** Is the financial model working?
4. **Governance Clarity:** Is decision-making effective?
5. **Impact Validity:** Are projects creating real outcomes?
6. **Shadow Accumulation:** Are we facing or avoiding difficulties?

**If any checkpoint fails: pause, address, then proceed.**
