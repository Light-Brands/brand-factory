# Phase 1: Pilot Design

> *"The pilot is not a small version of the vision. It is the vision, small enough to learn from."*

---

## Phase Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Phase** | 1 |
| **Name** | Pilot |
| **Duration** | Year 1-2 (post-gate approval) |
| **Status** | ⚪ Not Started |
| **Primary Focus** | Prove concept, learn, create playbook |

---

## Purpose

Phase 1 tests the Eco Heroes model at regional scale. The goal is not to create a perfect event, but to learn what works, what doesn't, and document everything for replication. Success is measured not just by the pilot event, but by the playbook and lessons that emerge.

---

## Pilot Parameters

| Parameter | Specification | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Scale** | Regional/bioregional | Minimize travel, maximize local relevance |
| **Teams** | 3-5 finalists | Small enough to support well |
| **Funding Pool** | $50-200K | Meaningful but not overwhelming |
| **Theme** | Locally relevant | Water, soil, urban, or other bioregional challenge |
| **Format** | Primarily in-person | Build community, test full experience |
| **Duration** | 2-3 day event | Long enough for depth, short enough for accessibility |
| **Integration** | 12-month support | Track implementation, not just event |

## Event Experience Design

### The Five Tournament Phases (Pilot Version)

#### Phase 1: The Summoning
- Call for applications goes out 3 months before event
- Marketing emphasizes local/bioregional challenge
- Application includes project proposal + personal story + team composition
- Selection considers innovation, feasibility, integrity

#### Phase 2: The Circle Forms
- 3-5 teams selected as finalists
- Wisdom council (5-7 people) makes selection
- Selection criteria weighted: 40% impact potential, 30% feasibility, 30% team/integrity
- Finalist announcement includes story spotlights
- Pre-event orientation covers ritual, format, expectations

#### Phase 3: The Arena
- 2-3 day in-person event
- Each team: 15 min presentation + 10 min Q&A + 5 min challenge
- Presentations combine storytelling, data, demonstration
- Arena designed as sacred space (see below)
- Live audience + livestream for broader community

#### Phase 4: The Weigh-In
- Audience votes via physical tokens or app
- Wisdom council votes (weighted 30% of total)
- Voting framed as sacred witnessing
- Results displayed transparently
- Multiple teams receive funding proportional to votes
- Minimum floor ensures all finalists get something

#### Phase 5: The Integration
- Immediately post-event: integration launch ceremony
- Teams enter 12-month support program
- Support pods assigned
- Funding released in tranches
- Quarterly ceremonial check-ins
- Final celebration at 12 months

### Arena Design (Pilot Version)

**Physical Space:**
- Circular or semi-circular seating
- Natural elements (plants, water feature if possible)
- Sacred geometry in stage design
- Four directional markers (optional, with cultural guidance)
- Lighting that shifts with event phases

**Ceremonial Elements:**
- Opening blessing by local/indigenous leader (if appropriate)
- Team processional with symbols
- Transition rituals between presentations
- Voting ceremony with mindful pause
- Closing gratitude circle

**Technology:**
- Live streaming capability
- Online voting integration
- Impact visualization on screens
- Recording for documentation

**Simplicity Principle:**
- Pilot should be "minimum viable ceremony"
- Avoid over-production
- Focus on authenticity over spectacle
- Learn what resonates before scaling

## Phase Transition Decision

At the end of Phase 1, the founding circle and Council will evaluate:

1. **Did the pilot achieve its success metrics?**
2. **Is the playbook complete and replicable?**
3. **Are there fatal flaws that prevent scaling?**
4. **Is the financial model viable at larger scale?**
5. **Did projects create genuine regenerative impact?**
6. **Is the team ready for Phase 2 expansion?**

If yes to all: Proceed to Phase 2.
If no to any: Address gaps or consider pause/pivot.
