# Pre-Launch Gates

> Five requirements that must be completed before Earth Weavers can proceed to pilot launch.

---

## Transformation Notice

**Note:** Through the Divine Light Transformation (January 2026), "Eco Heroes" has been reborn as **Earth Weavers**. Two gates are now complete, and frameworks for remaining gates have been designed. See [Divine Light Transformation](../02-divine-light-transformation.md) for details.

---

## Overview

The Stewardship Council has identified five critical areas that require resolution before Earth Weavers can responsibly move forward. These are not bureaucratic hurdles — they are sacred thresholds ensuring the initiative is born with integrity.

**All gates must reach 🟢 Complete status before proceeding.**

## Gate Documents

### [Gate 1: Cultural Partnership](./01-cultural-partnership.md)
**Owner:** 🔥 Flame of Cultural Restoration
**Timeline:** 3-6 months (longest lead time)

Ensures indigenous and cultural partnerships are genuine, reciprocal, and carry appropriate authority. This gate addresses the critical risk of cultural appropriation and ensures ceremonial elements come from authentic relationship.

**Key Requirements:**
- Indigenous Advisory Council with veto power
- Reciprocal funding commitments
- Cultural impact assessment
- Non-Western narrative flexibility

---

### [Gate 2: Economic Sustainability](./02-economic-sustainability.md)
**Owner:** ⚖️ Steward of Exchange
**Timeline:** 2-4 months

Ensures the financial model is sustainable beyond philanthropic dependence. This gate addresses the risk of launching with beautiful vision but no viable economics.

**Key Requirements:**
- 3-year financial model
- Multiple revenue streams
- Participant compensation structure
- Funding contingency scenarios

---

### [Gate 3: Governance Simplification](./03-governance-simplification.md)
**Owner:** 💠 Architect of Sacred Systems
**Timeline:** 2-3 months

Ensures decision-making is clear and effective without becoming bureaucratic. This gate addresses the risk of governance paralysis from too many councils and stakeholders.

**Key Requirements:**
- RACI matrix for all key decisions
- Minimum viable governance for pilot
- Scalability plan
- Clear authority structures

---

### [Gate 4: Shadow Integration](./04-shadow-integration.md)
**Owner:** 🪞 Mirror of the Multiverse
**Timeline:** 1-2 months (shortest timeline)

Ensures the team has faced the shadow aspects of the vision and built appropriate safeguards. This gate addresses the risks of savior complex, spectacle addiction, and spiritual bypassing.

**Key Requirements:**
- Pre-mortem exercise completed
- Language reframe from "hero" to relational
- Accountability structures designed
- Founder risk addressed

---

### [Gate 5: Ecological Integrity](./05-ecological-integrity.md)
**Owner:** 🌱 Guardian of Gaia
**Timeline:** 2-3 months

Ensures the event itself is regenerative, not extractive. This gate addresses the irony risk of creating environmental harm while claiming to heal the Earth.

**Key Requirements:**
- Carbon-neutral operations plan
- Third-party impact verification system
- Bioregional pilot preference
- Greenwashing prevention protocols

---

## Gate Review Process

### How Gates Are Completed

1. **Work Phase:** Gate owner leads completion of all requirements
2. **Documentation:** All deliverables documented in gate file
3. **Self-Assessment:** Gate owner marks as 🟡 Ready for Review
4. **Council Review:** Relevant Council member verifies completion
5. **Approval:** Council member marks as 🟢 Complete

### Council Review Meeting

When all gates show 🟡 Ready for Review or 🟢 Complete:

1. Full Council convenes for Gate Review
2. Each gate owner presents completion evidence
3. Council deliberates and asks questions
4. Unanimous consent required for passage
5. If any gate fails: specific remediation assigned
6. If all gates pass: Proceed to Phase 1 authorized

---

## Parallel vs. Sequential Work

**Can be done in parallel:**
- Gates 2, 3, 4, 5 can all begin immediately
- Gate 1 requires longest lead time — start immediately

**Dependencies:**
- Gate 1 (Cultural) → Informs Gate 5 (Ecological) on bioregional approach
- Gate 4 (Shadow) → Informs Gate 3 (Governance) on accountability structures
- Gate 2 (Economic) → Informs all other gates on resource constraints

**Recommended Sequence:**
1. Start Gate 1 and Gate 4 immediately (longest and shortest)
2. Begin Gate 2 within first month
3. Begin Gates 3 and 5 as Gates 1 and 4 progress
4. Complete Gate 4 first to inform other gates
5. Complete Gates 2 and 3 mid-process
6. Complete Gates 1 and 5 last

---

## Gate Ownership

Each gate has:
- **Council Owner:** The Stewardship Council member with oversight
- **Legion Support:** Relevant armies providing assistance
- **Working Lead:** Person doing the day-to-day work (to be assigned)

| Gate | Council Owner | Legion Support |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Flame | Permissionkeepers, Lorekeepers |
| 2 | Steward | Measurekeepers, Offerers |
| 3 | Architect | Patternwrights, Sealbearers |
| 4 | Mirror | Shadowseers, Pathsplitters |
| 5 | Guardian | Forest Sentinels, Watercallers |

---

## Failure Modes

If a gate cannot be completed:

1. **Identify blockers:** What specifically is preventing completion?
2. **Escalate to Council:** Report to full Council for guidance
3. **Assess options:**
   - Can requirements be modified while preserving intent?
   - Is more time needed?
   - Is the project fundamentally unviable?
4. **Council decision:** Proceed, pause, or terminate

**The Council reserves the right to halt the project if gates cannot be completed in good faith.**

## Next Steps

1. Appoint Working Leads for each gate
2. Begin Gate 1 and Gate 4 immediately
3. Schedule first gate check-in (30 days)
4. Schedule Council Gate Review (target: 6 months)
