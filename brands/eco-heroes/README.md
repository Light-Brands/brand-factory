# Earth Weavers — The Regeneration Games

> *"We are not heroes saving Earth. We are children returning home, learning to tend the garden we forgot was sacred."*

## Transformation Notice

**Formerly "Eco Heroes"** — Through deep Council reflection and shadow integration work, this brand has been transformed into **Earth Weavers**. See [Divine Light Transformation](./02-divine-light-transformation.md) for the complete vision.

---

## Overview

Earth Weavers is a global movement where communities come together not to compete for victory, but to **collaborate for emergence** — demonstrating that humanity's creative energy, when woven in right relationship with Earth, can regenerate what has been torn.

We do not save Earth. We remember that we ARE Earth.

## The Transformed Vision

### From Heroes to Weavers

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Heroes saving Earth" | Stewards healing *with* Earth |
| Competition for victory | Collaboration for emergence |
| Tournament with winners | Weaving Circle where all threads matter |
| Spectacle as end | Ritual as pathway |
| Western narrative dominance | Many stories, one song |

### Five Sacred Truths

1. **Every Thread is Essential** — Each participant, each species, each community is a vital thread in Earth's tapestry
2. **Stillness Before Motion** — We listen before we act, we pray before we plan, we honor before we harvest
3. **The Pattern Reveals Itself** — Success is not winning but witnessing what emerges when we weave together
4. **All Exchange is Sacred** — Resources flow like water to where they are needed, held lightly, given freely
5. **Earth Speaks, We Listen** — Her flourishing is our only measure; her voice guides every choice

### The Weaving Circle (Five Movements)

1. **The Listening** — Communities sense what Earth asks of their bioregion
2. **The Offering** — Teams present their healing intentions to the Circle
3. **The Weaving** — Teams discover connections between their projects
4. **The Blessing** — Community and Council distribute resources to all threads
5. **The Tending** — 12-month integration where all projects are supported
