## The Vision

### Core Concept
A team-based global tournament where:
- Players compete by proposing and implementing regenerative solutions
- Victory is measured by magnitude of positive impact created
- Funding flows to multiple teams based on collective voting
- Ancient ritual integrates with modern systems design
- The arena becomes both temple and laboratory

### Five Tournament Phases
1. **The Summoning** — Global call to action
2. **The Circle Forms** — Selection of finalists
3. **The Arena** — Live showcase event
4. **The Weigh-In** — Voting and funding distribution
5. **The Integration** — Post-game activation and implementation

### Core Principles
- Every Being is a Sacred Node
- Ritual Precedes Action
- Victory is Shared Emergence
- Money is Conscious Energy
- Earth is the Ultimate Arbiter
