## Risk Checkpoints

At each phase transition, assess:

2. **Cultural Integrity:** Are indigenous and cultural partnerships genuine?
3. **Economic Health:** Is the financial model sustainable?
4. **Governance Clarity:** Is decision-making effective and values-aligned?
5. **Impact Validity:** Are projects creating real regenerative outcomes?
6. **Shadow Accumulation:** Are we facing or avoiding difficult truths?

**If any checkpoint fails, pause expansion and address before continuing.**
