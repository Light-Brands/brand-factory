# Governance

> *"Good governance is invisible when it works. It's the container that lets content flow."*

## Overview

This section documents the governance structures, decision-making frameworks, and accountability mechanisms for Eco Heroes. Governance must balance:

- **Speed** with **inclusion**
- **Autonomy** with **coherence**
- **Innovation** with **integrity**
- **Distribution** with **accountability**

## Governance Principles

### 1. Minimum Viable Governance
Use the simplest governance that works. Add complexity only when necessary. Every layer must earn its existence.

### 2. Clear Accountability
Every decision has exactly one accountable party. Consultation is good; diffusion is not.

### 3. Speed Where Needed
Operational decisions should be fast. Strategic decisions can be slower. Know the difference.

### 4. Earned Autonomy
Trust is earned through demonstrated alignment. New chapters start with more oversight; proven chapters get more freedom.

### 5. Transparent Process
Decisions and their reasoning are documented. Stakeholders can trace how choices were made.

### 6. Cultural Veto
Indigenous Advisory Council has genuine veto power over cultural elements. This is not negotiable.

### 7. Mission First
When governance conflicts arise, return to mission and principles. Structure serves purpose, not the reverse.

## Governance Evolution

| Phase | Primary Body | Staff Size | Complexity |
|-------|--------------|------------|------------|
| 0 | Founding Circle | 2-3 | Minimal |
| 1 | Founding Circle + Event Lead | 5-8 | Basic |
| 2 | Alliance Council | 25-40 | Moderate |
| 3 | Alliance + Regional Councils | 50-100 | Full |

Governance complexity should match organizational complexity — no more, no less.
