## About Section (2,000 characters max)

Light Brand Consulting illuminates the path between where your business is and where AI can take it.

We work with founders, CEOs, and established businesses ($1M–$50M) who sense that AI is important — but lack the clarity to act decisively.

Heavy consulting creates dependency. We create capacity.

Your business already contains its own genius. AI reveals it. A 70% solution today outperforms 100% in six months. One clear insight changes everything.

OUR SERVICES:

💡 Illumination Session ($500)
90 minutes to uncover your top 3 AI opportunities, your Super Intelligence Profile, and a Momentum Plan to act on immediately.

📐 AI Acceleration Blueprint ($3,000–$7,500)
Complete strategic architecture delivered in 5–7 business days. Business model analysis, tech stack recommendations, implementation sequence, and ROI projections.

📖 Breath of Life Story ($2,500–$12,000)
Crystallize your authority through authentic storytelling. Three-session deep dive producing narrative architecture, book outline, or manifesto.

OUR PHILOSOPHY:

Every engagement delivers standalone value. Every deliverable is executable without our involvement. Every client leaves more capable than they arrived.

We'd rather our clients succeed without us than depend on us. That's not bad business — that's the best business.

THE LIGHT TOUCH PRINCIPLE:
We don't build heavy systems. We illuminate what's already extraordinary within you — then step back.

Story + Strategy + Speed + AI Leverage.

The businesses that thrive in the next decade won't be the ones with the most resources. They'll be the ones who saw clearly, moved decisively, and let AI amplify what was already extraordinary within them.

## Post Templates

### Template 1: Thought Leadership Article

**Format:** Long-form text (1,300+ characters) + article link or document image

**Structure:**
```
[Provocative opening line — a truth most people avoid]

[3–4 paragraphs of genuine insight with frameworks or data]

[Key takeaway — actionable and memorable]

[Soft CTA — question to spark conversation, or link to service]

#AIStrategy #BusinessTransformation #LightBrandConsulting
```

**Example:**

The AI readiness gap isn't about technology. It's about clarity.

I've worked with dozens of businesses this year. The ones that are thriving with AI have one thing in common — and it's not budget, team size, or technical sophistication.

It's this: they answered one question before they bought a single tool.

"Where does AI actually create value for US?"

Not where it creates value in theory. Not where it works for their competitor. For them. Their operations, their clients, their data, their people.

Most businesses skip this question entirely. They adopt tools because they're trending. They automate processes that shouldn't exist in the first place. They build before they see.

Here's a three-step framework we use in every Illumination Session:

1. Audit your manual processes — the ones that drain your best people
2. Map your data — where it exists, where it's ignored, where it leaks
3. Identify your Decision Leverage Point — the single decision that, if made faster or better, would change everything

That third step? That's where transformation begins.

Clarity first. Technology second. Always.

What's the one decision in your business that, if faster, would change everything?

### Template 2: Client Case Study

**Format:** Text + professional graphic or carousel (before/after)

**Structure:**
```
[Headline result — specific metric or outcome]

[Client context — relatable situation, no names unless permitted]

[What we did — the illumination, not the technology]

[Specific results — numbers, timelines, tangible outcomes]

[Principle — what made this possible]

[CTA — link to service or invitation to connect]
```

**Example:**

65% reduction in proposal time. 28% increase in revenue per employee.

A $4M professional services firm came to us running on spreadsheets, institutional knowledge locked in one person's head, and 12-hour days that never seemed to shorten.

They didn't need an AI overhaul. They needed to see what was already there.

In one Illumination Session, we uncovered three things:
→ 80% of their proposal content was repeatable — but being written from scratch every time
→ Their 5 years of client data held patterns nobody had ever analyzed
→ Their founder's expertise could be productized into an AI-assisted diagnostic tool

Within 6 weeks, they had:
✓ An AI-assisted proposal system reducing generation time by 65%
✓ A client pattern dashboard surfacing upsell opportunities
✓ A productized diagnostic generating new leads on autopilot

No heavy systems. No 6-month implementations. No dependency.

This is the Light Touch Principle in action — illuminate what's already extraordinary, then step back.

### Template 3: Philosophy / Methodology Post

**Format:** Text-only or text + minimal quote graphic

**Structure:**
```
[Contrarian insight or strong position]

[2–3 paragraphs developing the idea]

[Connect to how Light Brand Consulting operates differently]

[End with a question or reflection — no hard sell]
```

**Example:**

Heavy consulting creates dependency. Light consulting creates capacity.

This isn't just our tagline. It's our operating system.

Every engagement we deliver passes a simple test: Can our client execute on this without us?

If the answer is no, we've failed. If the deliverable requires ongoing interpretation, handholding, or — worst of all — another engagement just to make sense of the first one, we've built the wrong thing.

Here's what we check after every single delivery:

1. Can the client articulate what they learned?
2. Are the deliverables actionable independently?
3. Are next steps clear — whether or not they involve us?
4. Did we create capacity, or did we create need?

The consulting industry has a dirty secret: complexity is profitable. The more confusing the deliverable, the more likely the follow-up contract.

We reject that entirely.

Clarity is the multiplier. Not complexity.

What would change if your next consultant's goal was to make themselves unnecessary?

### Template 4: Service Announcement / CTA

**Format:** Text + branded graphic with clear offer details

**Structure:**
```
[Direct, value-forward opening]

[Exactly what they get — bullet points]

[Who it's for]

[Clear CTA]
```

**Example:**

3 Illumination Sessions available this month.

Here's exactly what you walk away with in 90 minutes:

✓ Your Super Intelligence Profile — a clear picture of where AI fits your business right now
✓ Top 3 AI Opportunities — ranked by impact, feasibility, and speed to value
✓ Your Momentum Plan — what to do first, what to do next, what to ignore
✓ A written summary delivered within 48 hours — executable without us

This is for you if:
→ You're a founder or CEO running a $1M–$50M business
→ You know AI matters but don't know where to start
→ You want clarity, not a sales pitch for a bigger engagement

Investment: $500.

We'd rather give you 90 minutes of clarity than 6 months of consulting. That's the Light Touch Principle.

### Template 5: Personal Brand (Dan's Profile Posts)

**Format:** First-person narrative, text-heavy, authentic

**Structure:**
```
[Personal observation or experience]

[Connect to a broader business/AI truth]

[Share a framework, lesson, or perspective]

[Invite conversation — question, not CTA]
```

**Example:**

I told a potential client last week that they didn't need us.

They came in ready to buy a full AI Acceleration Blueprint. $7,500 engagement. Signed and ready.

After 30 minutes of conversation, I realized something: they didn't have a strategy problem. They had an execution problem. Their team already knew what to do — they just needed permission to do it differently.

So I said: "Save your $7,500. Here's what I'd do if I were you." And I spent the next hour giving them exactly that.

Did I leave money on the table? Maybe.

But here's what I've learned building Light Brand Consulting: trust compounds faster than revenue.

That founder has since referred three other businesses to us. All three became clients.

The Light Touch Principle isn't just about consulting methodology. It's about playing a long game in a short-game world.

When was the last time a consultant told you NOT to buy?
