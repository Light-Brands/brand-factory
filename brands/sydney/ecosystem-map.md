# Ecosystem Map

> *How the four projects flow into and reinforce each other.*

This document maps the relationships, resource flows, and interdependencies between the four projects stewarded by Sydney, based on the ecosystem diagram.

## Project Roles

### Planetary Party -- The Cultural Engine
**Role**: Ecosystem, Community Engagement & Festivals

The top of the ecosystem. Planetary Party is the outward-facing cultural layer -- the festivals, events, and community gatherings that bring people into the ecosystem, generate visibility, and build the relational fabric that holds everything together.

### Permatours -- The Action Network
**Role**: Permaculture Action & Mutual Aid Network

The connective tissue across the NE bioregion. Permatours links permaculture practitioners, projects, and hubs into a mutual aid network. It brings volunteers, skills, and aligned partnerships into the ecosystem while extending the ecosystem's reach outward through regional NE Hubs.

### Unified Sanctuaries -- The Physical Anchor
**Role**: Land-Based Project & Community

The ground truth. A regenerative village integrating farm, retreat center, event venue, and community living. This is where the vision becomes physical -- food is grown, people live, retreats happen, and the circular economy operates.

### Kinship Earth -- The Funding Channel
**Role**: Flow Funding & Grants

The nonprofit vehicle that channels grants, flow funding, and philanthropic capital into the ecosystem. Kinship Earth provides the fiscal infrastructure and legitimacy to attract institutional and foundation support.

## Resource Flows

### Planetary Party <-> Unified Sanctuaries (Gold Arrows)
**Bidirectional -- Culture and Place**

- **PP -> US**: Planetary Party events bring people, energy, and revenue to the land. Festivals and gatherings hosted at Unified Sanctuaries generate ticket sales, visibility, and potential future residents/stewards.
- **US -> PP**: Unified Sanctuaries provides the physical venue, infrastructure, lodging, and food systems that make Planetary Party events possible. The land is the stage.

### Planetary Party <-> Kinship Earth (Blue Arrows)
**Bidirectional -- Engagement and Funding**

- **PP -> KE**: Events generate donor engagement, storytelling content, and awareness that fuels Kinship Earth's fundraising. Attendees become donors and advocates.
- **KE -> PP**: Kinship Earth provides grant funding and fiscal sponsorship that supports event production and community programming.

### Kinship Earth -> Unified Sanctuaries (Blue Arrow + "Flow Funding Grants")
**Directional -- Capital Flow**

- Kinship Earth channels grants, flow funding, and impact capital directly into Unified Sanctuaries for land acquisition, infrastructure development, and operational support. This is the primary financial pipeline from the philanthropic world into the land project.

### Permatours <-> Unified Sanctuaries (Dashed Arrows)
**Bidirectional -- Network and Labor**

- **PT -> US**: Permatours brings volunteers, skilled practitioners, and aligned partnerships that reduce labor costs and increase capacity at the land project. The network also drives marketing and event ticket sales.
- **US -> PT**: Unified Sanctuaries serves as a flagship hub and demonstration site for the Permatours network. It provides a home base for network coordination and a model that other hubs can replicate.

### NE Hubs <-> Permatours (Dashed Arrows)
**Bidirectional -- Regional Network**

- NE Hubs are the distributed nodes of the Permatours network across the Northeast bioregion. They feed into the central network and benefit from its coordination, shared resources, and collective visibility.

### Permatours <-> Planetary Party (Implied)
**Indirect -- Events and Network**

- Permatours gatherings are hosted through Planetary Party events. The network provides attendees and facilitators; the event platform provides the production and cultural framework.

              UNIFIED SANCTUARIES
              The land where it all
              comes together -- food,
              shelter, healing, education,
              community living

## Key Insight

No single project works in isolation. The ecosystem's strength is its interdependence:

- Without **Planetary Party**, there's no cultural engine to attract people and tell the story
- Without **Permatours**, there's no regional network feeding skills, labor, and partnerships
- Without **Unified Sanctuaries**, there's no physical anchor where the vision is lived
- Without **Kinship Earth**, there's no institutional funding pipeline to sustain the work

Each project solves a piece of the puzzle that the others cannot.
