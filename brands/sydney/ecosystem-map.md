# Ecosystem Map

> *How the four projects flow into and reinforce each other -- and how Live with Syd weaves them into one living system.*

This document maps the relationships, resource flows, community infrastructure, and interdependencies across the ecosystem stewarded by Syd Harvey Griffith. It draws from the full body of Live with Syd documentation to present a comprehensive view of how culture, network, land, capital, and connective programming operate as a single regenerative engine.

---

## The Architect

At the center of this ecosystem is Syd -- a community organizer, movement builder, and regenerative finance leader who designed these four projects to function as one living system. She isn't just managing a portfolio; she's orchestrating a regenerative engine where culture funds the land, the land hosts the network, the network feeds the movement, and the movement attracts the capital.

Syd holds Executive Director roles, co-founder titles, and lead design seats across all four projects -- but more than titles, she holds the connective vision that makes the whole thing work. She's supported 40+ land-based projects, pioneered trust-based flow funding, and built a federated ecosystem that turns festivals into funding pipelines and mutual aid into systemic transformation.

Through Live with Syd, she also serves as the ecosystem's primary facilitator, educator, and public interface -- hosting weekly sessions that make the invisible connective tissue between projects visible and participatory.

### Weekly Rhythm

| Day | Theme | Pillar Served |
|---|---|---|
| **Monday** | Regenerative Capital Flows | Kinship Earth + whole ecosystem |
| **Wednesday** | Planetary Party Ecosystem | Planetary Party + governance layer |
| **Friday** | Unified Sanctuaries Development | Unified Sanctuaries + land projects |
| **Monthly** | Heart Sharing & Grief Transmutation | Whole ecosystem (emotional infrastructure) |

### What It Does for the Ecosystem

- **Makes the invisible visible**: Resource flows, governance experiments, and funding strategies are discussed openly, creating shared understanding across the ecosystem
- **Recruits and filters**: Registration and intentionality screening bring in values-aligned participants who become volunteers, donors, collaborators, residents, and guild members
- **Generates content**: Every session becomes replays, clips, newsletters, and social media -- feeding the storytelling engine that powers fundraising and community growth
- **Builds relational trust**: Co-creative format cultivates the trust that makes flow funding, mutual aid, and consent-based governance possible
- **Processes grief and burnout**: Monthly heart sharing circles provide the emotional infrastructure that sustains long-haul movement work

### Heart Sharing & Grief Transmutation Circles

A distinct offering that serves the whole ecosystem. Non-recorded, sacred containers for processing:
- Grief for ecosystems, species, landscapes, lost futures
- Burnout from organizing, funding, and building
- Rage, despair, numbness, overwhelm
- Tenderness, gratitude, remembrance

**Practices:** Guided grounding, breathwork, somatic awareness, gentle movement, sound/song/silence, council-style sharing, ritual and symbolic acts, collective witnessing, grief transmutation into clarity and action.

**Design:** Always non-recorded. Closed, intentional container. Trauma-informed facilitation. No fixing, no advice-giving. Deep listening and mutual care.

## Community Infrastructure

### Discord Architecture (4 Servers)

Each server maps to a core pillar, creating dedicated spaces for the communities that form around each:

| Server | Purpose | Tone | Growth Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Regenerative Capital Flows** | Learning and collaboration hub for unlocking capital | Strategic, experimental, grounded | 100 -- 500+ |
| **Planetary Party** | Coordination and governance laboratory | Visionary, mythic, strategic | 100 -- 1,000+ |
| **Unified Sanctuaries** | Real-time co-creation of land project | Place-based, grounded, practical | 50 -- 300 |
| **Grief & Transmutation Circles** | Sacred container for emotional processing | Gentle, quiet, reverent | 20 -- 150 |

**Cross-Server Patterns:** Each server includes welcome/orientation, general community space, topic-specific channels, collaboration zones, archives (replays + resources), and private mod/strategy channels. Unified Sanctuaries adds detailed channels for land, governance, design/build, funding, and programming. Planetary Party adds guild channels and bioregional hub channels.

**Who It's For:** Curious, collaborative, values-aligned people oriented toward regeneration -- willing to listen, reflect, and co-create. Comfortable with ambiguity and emergence. Committed to care, consent, and respect.

**Who It's Not For:** Sales pitches, self-promotion, ideological combativeness, financial speculation, harassment, domination behaviors, or anyone unwilling to honor community agreements.

**Community Agreements (10 Core):**
1. Come with presence and intention
2. Honor confidentiality
3. Speak from lived experience
4. No harassment, hate, or harmful speech
5. Respect the container (raise-hand, wait to be invited)
6. Consent before recording or sharing
7. Honor time and space
8. Stay curious, not combative
9. Support collective coherence
10. Right to removal (moderators may mute, remove, or ban)

**Conflict & Accountability Pathway:**
1. Message moderator privately
2. Moderators may pause or redirect session
3. Serious cases: muted or removed
4. Follow-up dialogue or repair offered

---

## Content & Storytelling Pipeline

Storytelling is not an afterthought -- it is infrastructure. Every session, event, and gathering generates content that serves fundraising, community growth, and movement building.

## Key Insight

No single project works in isolation. The ecosystem's strength is its interdependence:

- Without **Planetary Party**, there's no cultural engine to attract people and tell the story
- Without **Permatours**, there's no regional network feeding skills, labor, and partnerships
- Without **Unified Sanctuaries**, there's no physical anchor where the vision is lived
- Without **Kinship Earth**, there's no institutional funding pipeline to sustain the work
- Without **Live with Syd**, there's no nervous system weaving it all into coherent, participatory, living practice

Each project solves a piece of the puzzle that the others cannot. Live with Syd makes the connections between them visible, cultivates the relationships that power them, generates the content that tells their story, and holds the emotional container that sustains the people doing the work.

And it's Syd who sees the whole picture -- the rare builder who moves fluently between soil and spreadsheets, singing circles and capital campaigns, governance design and festival production, grief circles and grant applications. That cross-domain fluency is the ecosystem's secret weapon.
