# Kinship Earth

> *Flow Funding & Grants*

Kinship Earth is the nonprofit funding vehicle of the Sydney ecosystem. It channels grants, flow funding, and philanthropic capital into the regenerative projects -- primarily Unified Sanctuaries -- while providing the fiscal infrastructure and institutional legitimacy needed to attract foundation support, government grants, and impact investment. Sydney serves as Executive Director.

## What It Is

A nonprofit organization focused on:

- **Grant acquisition** -- researching, applying for, and managing grants from foundations, government programs, and impact funds
- **Flow funding** -- facilitating the movement of philanthropic capital to where it's needed across the ecosystem
- **Fiscal sponsorship** -- potentially providing fiscal infrastructure for Permatours and Planetary Party before they have their own entities
- **Donor engagement** -- cultivating relationships with individual donors, family foundations, and institutional funders
- **Impact reporting** -- documenting and communicating the social, ecological, and community impact of the ecosystem

Kinship Earth is the bridge between the philanthropic world and the on-the-ground regenerative work.

## Role in the Ecosystem

- Provides the **primary financial pipeline** from the institutional/philanthropic world into Unified Sanctuaries
- Channels **flow funding grants** for land acquisition, infrastructure, and community development
- Offers potential **fiscal sponsorship** for other projects that don't yet have their own entities
- Converts **event engagement into donor relationships** through Planetary Party touchpoints
- Manages **impact measurement and reporting** that satisfies funders and attracts new capital
- Brings **institutional credibility** that opens doors the other projects can't access alone

## What Makes It Unique

- **Flow funding model** -- capital moves to where it's most needed, not locked into rigid program budgets
- **Ecosystem approach** -- funds a system of interconnected projects, not isolated programs
- **Event-integrated fundraising** -- Planetary Party events double as donor cultivation
- **Aligned values** -- funding supports non-speculative, community-governed, land-based projects
- **Storytelling-driven** -- the media and content produced by the ecosystem becomes the case for support

## Scoping Questions to Resolve

### Organizational Status
- [ ] What is Kinship Earth's current legal status? Active 501(c)(3)? State of incorporation?
- [ ] What's the current board composition?
- [ ] Is Sydney the sole staff member, or are there others?
- [ ] What's the current annual budget and funding pipeline?

### Funding Strategy
- [ ] What grant programs are being targeted? (USDA, state conservation, family foundations, climate funds?)
- [ ] What's the flow funding strategy? Who are the flow funders in the network?
- [ ] What's the donor cultivation pipeline? Major donors, mid-level, grassroots?
- [ ] Capital campaign planning for Unified Sanctuaries land acquisition?
- [ ] What's the earned revenue model, if any? (Consulting, training, publications?)

### Fiscal Relationships
- [ ] Does Kinship Earth fiscally sponsor any of the other three projects currently?
- [ ] What's the planned entity structure? Should Planetary Party and Permatours be programs of KE, or separate entities?
- [ ] How does money flow from KE to Unified Sanctuaries? Direct grants? Program funding? Through the trust?

### Impact & Reporting
- [ ] What metrics and impact data are currently being tracked?
- [ ] What reporting frameworks are in use? (IRIS+, custom, funder-specific?)
- [ ] How is the ecosystem's collective impact measured and communicated?

### Digital Presence
- [ ] Current website status and needs?
- [ ] Donor communication channels -- newsletter, social, annual report?
- [ ] Online donation infrastructure -- platform, recurring giving, campaign pages?

## Initial Planning Steps

1. **Audit current status** -- document Kinship Earth's legal status, board, budget, and active grants
2. **Map the funding landscape** -- identify target grant programs, foundations, and flow funding networks aligned with the ecosystem's work
3. **Define the fiscal architecture** -- how money flows between KE and the other three projects (entity structure, agreements, reporting)
4. **Build the case for support** -- a compelling narrative document that positions the four-project ecosystem as a fundable whole
5. **Plan a capital campaign** -- scope and timeline for Unified Sanctuaries land acquisition fundraising
6. **Set up donor engagement pipeline** -- integrate with Planetary Party events for cultivation and stewardship

## Key People

- **Sydney** -- Executive Director, regenerative organizer, network weaver
- **Michael (Fuego)** -- Financial operations, accounting, compliance

## Grant & Funding Targets to Research

- USDA Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development
- USDA Community Facilities Direct Loan & Grant Program
- Vermont Housing & Conservation Board (VHCB)
- Vermont Community Foundation
- Climate and soil carbon credit programs
- Family foundations focused on regenerative agriculture, land access, community resilience
- Flow funding networks (e.g., RSF Social Finance, Thousand Currents)
- Impact investors focused on regenerative real estate / land stewardship

## Connection Points

- **-> Unified Sanctuaries**: Primary recipient of grants, flow funding, and capital campaign proceeds
- **<- Planetary Party**: Events generate donor engagement and storytelling content
- **<-> Permatours**: Potential fiscal sponsor; network strengthens grant narratives
- **-> Ecosystem**: Provides the institutional credibility and financial infrastructure for the whole system
