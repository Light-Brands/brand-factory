> *An interconnected ecosystem of four regenerative projects building a new paradigm for community, land stewardship, and collective action.*

Sydney is an umbrella brand housing four distinct but deeply interconnected projects. Each serves a unique role in a larger regenerative ecosystem -- from land-based community building to permaculture action networks, festival culture, and flow funding. Together they form a self-reinforcing system where community engagement feeds the land project, the land project hosts the network, the network activates hubs, and funding flows where it's needed most.

## The Four Projects

| Project | Role | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| [Planetary Party](./planetary-party/) | Ecosystem, Community Engagement & Festivals | The cultural heartbeat -- events, festivals, and gatherings that build community and generate visibility |
| [Permatours](./permatours/) | Permaculture Action & Mutual Aid Network | A network of permaculture practitioners, NE bioregional hubs, and mutual aid connecting projects across the region |
| [Unified Sanctuaries](./unified-sanctuaries/) | Land-Based Project & Community | The physical anchor -- a regenerative village with farm, retreat center, event venue, and community living |
| [Kinship Earth](./kinship-earth/) | Flow Funding & Grants | The nonprofit funding vehicle channeling grants and flow funding to support the ecosystem |

## How They Connect

The four projects form a circular, self-reinforcing ecosystem:

```
                    Planetary Party
                  (Events & Culture)
                   /        \
                  /          \
         Permatours          Kinship Earth
        (Network &           (Funding &
         Mutual Aid)          Grants)
                  \          /
                   \        /
               Unified Sanctuaries
               (Land & Community)
```

- **Planetary Party** generates community engagement, visibility, and culture that feeds all three other projects
- **Permatours** brings volunteers, partnerships, and a regional network that strengthens the land project and events
- **Unified Sanctuaries** provides the physical home base where gatherings happen, the network converges, and the vision is lived
- **Kinship Earth** channels grants and flow funding to support the land project and sustain the broader ecosystem

## Current Phase

**Planning & Scoping** -- Defining each project's scope, identity, and initial action steps while building on existing work in Unified Sanctuaries and established relationships across all four domains.
