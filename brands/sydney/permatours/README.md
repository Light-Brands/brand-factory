# Permatours

> *Permaculture Action & Mutual Aid Network*

Permatours is a bioregional network connecting permaculture practitioners, projects, and communities across the Northeast and beyond through mutual aid, skill-sharing, and collective action. It functions as the connective tissue of Sydney's project ecosystem -- linking people, labor, and knowledge across a distributed network of NE Hubs while channeling energy toward the Unified Sanctuaries land project.

## What It Is

A permaculture action and mutual aid network focused on:

- **NE Hubs** -- distributed nodes across the Northeast bioregion where permaculture practitioners gather, share skills, and support local projects
- **Mutual aid coordination** -- matching volunteers with projects that need hands, skills, and knowledge
- **Permaculture education tours** -- traveling workshops, farm visits, and skill-shares that move through the hub network
- **Documentary storytelling** -- capturing the network's work as media content (Permatours docuseries)
- **Partnership building** -- connecting aligned organizations, land projects, and practitioners

Permatours is not a single place. It's a living network that moves, connects, and builds capacity across the bioregion.

## Role in the Ecosystem

- Brings **volunteers and skilled labor** to Unified Sanctuaries, reducing costs and increasing capacity
- Generates **marketing power** through its distributed network -- more reach for event ticket sales and community recruitment
- Creates **aligned partnerships** that bring donors, practitioners, and institutional support
- Produces **media and IP** (docuseries, educational content) that generates visibility and revenue
- Serves as the **regional scaling mechanism** -- if the model works at Unified Sanctuaries, Permatours helps replicate it through NE Hubs

## What Makes It Unique

- **Network model, not a single project** -- distributed across the bioregion rather than anchored to one location
- **Mutual aid at the core** -- not transactional; built on reciprocity and solidarity
- **NE Hub system** -- local nodes that self-organize under shared values and coordination
- **Action-first** -- Permatours is about doing, not just talking. Work days, builds, plantings, harvests
- **Built-in media engine** -- every tour and project is documented, creating an ongoing docuseries

## Scoping Questions to Resolve

### Network Structure
- [ ] How many NE Hubs currently exist, and where?
- [ ] What does it take for a location/project to become an NE Hub?
- [ ] What's the governance model for the network? How do hubs self-organize while staying aligned?
- [ ] What shared resources and tools does the network provide to hubs?

### Programming & Activities
- [ ] What does a typical Permatours action look like? Duration, format, team size?
- [ ] What's the annual rhythm? Seasonal focus areas?
- [ ] How are volunteer matches made -- platform, coordinators, self-organized?
- [ ] What educational programming is offered? Certifications, workshops, apprenticeships?

### Operations & Structure
- [ ] Legal entity -- is Permatours its own nonprofit, an LLC, or a program under Kinship Earth?
- [ ] Who are the core coordinators beyond Sydney and Pato?
- [ ] What infrastructure is needed? (Communication platform, scheduling, logistics)
- [ ] How is the network funded? Membership dues, grants, event revenue, donations?

### Media & Content
- [ ] Permatours docuseries -- what stage is this at? Concept, filming, editing?
- [ ] Who produces the content? In-house, contracted, community-sourced?
- [ ] Distribution strategy -- streaming platforms, YouTube, festival circuit, educational licensing?
- [ ] How does media revenue flow back to the network and projects?

### Digital Presence
- [ ] Website/platform needs -- hub directory, volunteer matching, event calendar?
- [ ] Communication tools -- how do hubs stay connected?
- [ ] Social media and storytelling strategy

## Initial Planning Steps

1. **Map the existing network** -- document current hubs, practitioners, and active projects
2. **Define the hub model** -- what makes a hub, how they join, what they get, what they contribute
3. **Clarify the entity structure** -- how Permatours legally relates to the other three projects
4. **Plan a pilot tour/action** -- first coordinated network action to build momentum
5. **Scope the docuseries** -- format, production plan, distribution, and revenue model
6. **Build the communication infrastructure** -- how the network stays connected day-to-day

## Key People

- **Sydney** -- Co-founder, network weaver, Executive Director of Kinship Earth
- **Pato** -- Permaculture installations, global hub partnerships, nonprofit management
- **Scotty** -- Soil science, compost co-op, natural building -- core practitioner and educator

## Connection Points

- **-> Unified Sanctuaries**: Flagship hub; volunteers and labor flow from network to land project
- **-> Planetary Party**: Network gatherings are hosted through Planetary Party events
- **-> Kinship Earth**: Potential fiscal sponsorship; grant funding for network operations
- **<- NE Hubs**: Distributed nodes feeding into and drawing from the central network
