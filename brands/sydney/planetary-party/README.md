# Planetary Party

> *Ecosystem, Community Engagement & Festivals*

Planetary Party is the cultural engine of Sydney's project ecosystem. It produces festivals, gatherings, and community events that build the relational fabric connecting people to regenerative living, to each other, and to the land. It is the outward-facing layer that generates visibility, storytelling, and community entry points for the broader ecosystem.

## What It Is

A community engagement and event production platform focused on:

- **Regenerative festivals** (e.g., Leave a Positive Trace)
- **Cultural gatherings** -- singing circles, theater, immersive arts, concerts
- **Educational events** -- governance workshops, permaculture education, community-building courses
- **Ecosystem events** -- gatherings that bring together the Permatours network, Kinship Earth donors, and Unified Sanctuaries community

Planetary Party is not just a party. It's the connective ritual space where the ecosystem meets itself and invites the world in.

## Role in the Ecosystem

- Generates **visibility and storytelling** content that fuels Kinship Earth's fundraising
- Brings **people and energy** to the Unified Sanctuaries land project
- Creates **donor touchpoints** that convert attendees into supporters
- Hosts **Permatours network gatherings** that strengthen the regional mutual aid fabric
- Produces **media and IP** (footage, performances, recordings) that become ongoing revenue streams

## What Makes It Unique

- Events are designed as **entry points** into a regenerative lifestyle, not one-off entertainment
- Festival revenue directly supports the land project and community infrastructure
- Built-in **media production** captures every event for storytelling, documentary content, and online distribution
- Programming blends **celebration with education** -- every gathering teaches something
- Rooted in **consent culture, inclusion, and ecological ethics**

## Initial Planning Steps

1. **Define the brand** -- name confirmation, tagline, visual identity direction, audience
2. **Map the event calendar** -- what events, when, where, at what scale
3. **Clarify the entity structure** -- how Planetary Party legally relates to the other three projects
4. **Scope the first event** -- format, budget, venue, team, timeline
5. **Build the storytelling engine** -- how every event generates content that feeds the ecosystem
