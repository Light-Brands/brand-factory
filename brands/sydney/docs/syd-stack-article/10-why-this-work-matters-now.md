# Why This Work Matters Now

We are facing:

- A **legitimacy crisis** in our institutions
- A **meaning crisis** in our culture
- A **trust crisis** in our financial systems
- A **coherence crisis** in our governance
- A **relational crisis** in our communities
- A **worldview crisis** moving from fragmentation to kinship/interdependence

And all of these crises are unfolding in a world where wars continue over land, ideology, and power — even as so many people I know are awake to how obsolete these paradigms are. And yet...

We are watching mass violence unfold as if these ideologies are inevitable, as if domination is normal, as if the Earth is property rather than a living system we belong to and are meant to steward together.

It feels like a profound split in consciousness.

- On one side: Extraordinary human intelligence, creativity, compassion, and technological capacity.
- On the other: Systems of power still operating from ancient logics of control, scarcity, and conquest.

We are watching the old world dissolve in real time as the new world is being birthed.

## The Spirit of the Planetary Party

Buckminster Fuller once said:

> *"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."*

That is the spirit of the Planetary Party:

Not an escape from reality or an oversimplified, utopian fantasy, but a grounded, joyful, relational, and coordinated way of building something better — together.

We are co-creating the Planetary Party to help people step fully into their gifts and offer those gifts as a service of life. In many ways, we are co-creating a shared pattern language for living systems — one that allows life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to take form in just and regenerative ways. We see the Planetary Party as a whole-system catalyst for imagineering a world that works for all.
