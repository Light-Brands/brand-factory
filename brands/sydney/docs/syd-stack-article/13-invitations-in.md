# Invitations In

If you feel resonance and want to explore what's emerging, here are a few ways to step in:

## Explore the Planetary Party

Express your interest in participating in the Planetary Party ecosystem — including guilds, collaborations, and upcoming calls.

## Learn & Sense Together

Express interest in joining upcoming LIVE learning sessions and conversations on Regenerative Capital Flows — including Flow Funding and trust-based philanthropy, regenerative crypto / community currencies / digital assets, cooperative finance, green bonds, carbon and biodiversity credits, social impact investing, commitment pooling, other alternative financial tools, and real-world case studies.

## Bring Flow Funding to Your Bioregion

If you are part of a place-based organizing group, community, or network, explore what it would mean to launch a Bioregional Flow Fund where you live — supported by Kinship Earth.

## Land-Based Co-Creation (Unified Sanctuaries)

If you feel called to land stewardship, regenerative community, and place-based experimentation, express interest in supporting or co-creating Unified Sanctuaries — a land-based project and living blueprint for collective stewardship in the Northeast.

## Supporting the Flow of Unrestricted Resources to Grassroots Change-makers

If you are in a position to resource this work, you are invited to support Kinship Earth's Bioregional Flow Funding efforts — moving capital directly into the hands of bioregional organizers and communities serving life, in partnership with The Planetary Party Ecosystem.
