# A Personal Through-Line (and What's Next)

The last few months of my life have felt like jumping between parallel worlds:

- **Mexico** — weaving with bioregional communities and grassroots changemakers
- **NYC Climate Week** — interfacing with climate capital / funds, artists, and technologists
- **Guatemala** — attending the Prophetic DAO incubator re: ways to decentralize decision making and develop community currencies that rewards Earth-centered projects and behaviors
- **The World Economic Forum and the World Systemic Forum** — global power + regenerative and systemic-healing focused convergence

I've been moving between worlds of wealth and influence and worlds of grassroots community — and carrying insights back into The Planetary Party, Kinship Earth, Permatours, and Unified Sanctuaries (a regenerative land project I'm co-creating in the Northeast). As permaculturists and ecophilosophers, the place where two ecosystems come together is the place of greatest fertility.

And now, I'm opening the field more intentionally.
