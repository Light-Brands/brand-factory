# Guilds = Pathways into the Planetary Party

We are organizing within a Guild ecosystem — serving as a living pathway for different people and organizations to co-create. The Guilds that have emerged thus far include:

- **Living Systems & Solutions** — land, food, water, energy, restoration

- **Capacity Building** — training, healing, leadership development

- **Regenerative Capital Flows** — Flow Funds, investment, multi-capital design

- **Governance** — participatory systems and collective decision making methods, legal scaffolding

- **Events** — gatherings, festivals, cultural activations

- **Storytelling** — media, myth, narrative infrastructure

- **Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard Process** — sense-making, mapping, data collection, impact visibility

- **Tech** — regenerative tooling and interoperability support

- **Guild Ecosystem Weaving** — cross-guild synergy and coordination; synergy reveals an emergent paradigm in which reality itself organizes toward higher-order coherence rather than being engineered from the top down.
