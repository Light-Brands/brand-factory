# Live Streaming — Starting in March 2026

Starting in March 2026, I'll be going LIVE, streaming the following discussions:

## Regenerative Capital Flows Education & Ideation

Learning and [discussion](https://forms.gle/qQWggdiH5YDfytvv8) on the many paths to unlocking capital for local, bioregional communities, e.g. Bioregional Flow Funding, carbon / biodiversity credit market, data collection, regenerative cryptocurrencies and digital assets, green bonds, social impact investment, grants, commitment pooling, co-operative structures / resource pooling, etc.

## Planetary Party Collaboration & Ecosystem Building

Guild-building, governance co-creation, bioregional community weaving, Q&As, etc.

## Unified Sanctuaries Development & Landing

A land-based project I am [co-creating](https://forms.gle/UHrfJGd7aKYoUQwu5) in the Northeast (likely Vermont) — a home for innovation, healing, permaculture, the bioregional movement, and the Planetary Party; a blueprint for regenerative communities shifting from private ownership to collective stewardship.

## Heart Sharing

A space to slow down, be witnessed, and share what we're carrying — grounding this work in care, presence, and collective integration. Trained facilitators will be invited to help hold these circles so that our coordination and creation are supported by emotional and relational coherence.

**The solutions are already distributed across the collective. Our work is to convene, weave, and steward.**
