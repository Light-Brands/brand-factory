# What I Felt and Witnessed in Davos

The emotional texture of Davos was striking.

On one level, there was real optimism about regenerative tools / tech and new economic models. On another level, there was a palpable sense of existential urgency, social fragmentation, and civilizational instability.

What stood out most to me was how many regenerative ecosystem builders were present — and how strong the emphasis was on collaboration. There was a shared inquiry on how to move beyond isolated projects and into deeper coordination; how to become networks of networks; an ecosystem of ecosystems rather than siloed initiatives.

Examples include the Global Regenerative Development Alliance, and Global Alliance of ReGeneration (stewarded by Marc Buckley[^1], Daniel Nicolai[^2], Dina Baenninger[^3], and others), Terramonia (nurtured by Peter Michel Heilmann[^4] and others), Gaia Commons[^5] (Silvana Raveane[^6], etc.), Quorum1 (Hank Holiday[^7], etc.), the World Systemic Forum Community (Anastasia Kalinina[^8], Greta Pappa[^9], Rudolf Hilti[^10], etc.), Cities of Future (Mariia Koshkina[^11] and Konstantyn Chyzhyk[^12]), Holomovement (Rachel Morrison), and more.

There was also demonstrable energy around creating **biomimetic governance** — designing institutions that reflect nature, including how our own bodies work — distributed intelligence, self-regulation, feedback loops, resilience through diversity, and coordinated autonomy.

I also encountered a growing number of initiatives exploring the implications of **AI becoming conscious**, with a strong emphasis on ethical alignment, safeguards, and governance to prevent dystopian outcomes and ensure emerging intelligence evolves in service of life.

When I spoke of bioregionalism, Flow Funding with Kinship Earth[^13], and the Planetary Party, I received strong, encouraging feedback. It felt timely and resonant for people — especially as an alternative pathway for coordination beyond nation-states and extractive economic systems.

> **Note:** Bioregionalism is the organizing around natural systems — watersheds, ecosystems, cultures, and foodsheds — rather than political borders. It offers a place-based way of coordinating care, resources, and governance that feels especially relevant in a time of global fragmentation. *(This will be unpacked further in [Why Organize Bioregionally](./05-why-organize-bioregionally.md)).*

## Paul Stamets and the Science of Mushrooms

There was also a powerful blend of science, medicine, and mysticism within the space, too. In particular, Paul Stamets[^14] shared data on how mushrooms support:

- Consciousness expansion[^15]
- Addiction recovery[^16]
- Reducing partner violence[^17]
- Alzheimer's disease[^18]
- Ecological restoration, including saving the bees[^19]
- Immunity to future pandemics, e.g. bird flu

You can find the data on [Mushroom References](https://mushroomreferences.com/)[^20].

It was grounding to see evidence-based natural medicine woven into systemic solutions — balancing the policy talk and tech hype.

## Homo Universalis and the Regenaissance

Marc Buckley also brought his latest book, *[Homo Universalis](https://homouniversalis.life/)*[^21], into the field — a powerful articulation of the shift many of us are sensing, and what he and others describe as a **Regenaissance**: a collective remembering and reorientation toward life-centered ways of being. The book frames regeneration as a way of remembering how to belong to living systems again — moving beyond extractive civilization toward symbiosis and planetary intelligence. This perspective felt deeply aligned with the conversations unfolding throughout Davos.

## Language, Consciousness, and War Logic

Another recurring theme was language and consciousness. Across multiple talks and conversations, numerous participants surfaced how war logic lives deeply inside our everyday language, e.g.: *stakeholders, targets, campaigns.*

There exists a collective inquiry into how specific language shapes how individuals dominate, extract, influence, and control, sometimes without even realizing it.

## Two-Eyed Seeing

Thematically connected to language projection were the principles shared by Mindahi Bastida[^22] and Ryan (Ra) James Kemp[^23]: **two-eyed seeing** — the practice of holding both modern, scientific worldviews and Indigenous, relational, kinship-based ways of knowing at the same time. Not collapsing one into the other, or romanticizing either, but weaving them into a more complete way of sensing reality and designing systems.

This theme felt like a critical component — the key piece missing from many of the systems-change efforts evolving to shape the world today.

Two-eyed seeing offers both a philosophical and practical bridge for the Planetary Party. Rather than choosing between worlds, instead it promotes learning to stand in both at once: technological and relational, strategic and embodied, modern and Indigenous.

Through this lens, many long-standing disconnects make sense. Two-eyed seeing helps illuminate:

- Why technocratic solutions fail without relationship, trust, and care
- Why spiritual or cultural movements struggle without infrastructure and coordination
- Why governance systems collapse when divorced from land, body, and lived experience
- Why bioregionalism, regenerative finance, and cultural ceremony don't just complement one another — they belong together

What I've witnessed in spaces like Davos was not a lack of intelligence, capital, or innovation. It was a lack of integration. Two-eyed seeing solves this critical need by naming the capacity required to weave these worlds together without flattening either.

This integrative orientation — bridging inner and outer transformation — was echoed by ecosystems like reState Foundation[^24] and SuperSymmetry Institute[^25] — each working in different ways to design for coherence across governance, culture, economy, policy, and consciousness.
