# Unified Sanctuaries

> *Land-Based Project & Community*

Unified Sanctuaries is the physical anchor of Sydney's project ecosystem -- a regenerative, community-owned village integrating permaculture farming, a retreat and healing arts center, an event venue, and community living. It is where the vision becomes tangible: food is grown, people live, healing happens, and a circular economy operates. Located in Southern Vermont, it serves as the flagship demonstration site for the entire ecosystem.

## What It Is

A land-based regenerative community organized around four pillars:

1. **Permaculture Farm & Education Center** -- Regenerative agriculture, food sovereignty, a community cafe, and hands-on learning
2. **Retreat & Healing Arts Center + Bathhouse** -- Immersive retreats, somatic therapy, healing arts, and a spa/bathhouse
3. **Event Venue + Innovation Hall** -- Festivals, concerts, weddings, markets, conferences, and AV production
4. **Community Living / Regenerative Neighborhood** -- Eco-homes, tiny dwellings, shared stewardship, and cooperative living (20+ homes)

## Role in the Ecosystem

- Provides the **physical venue and infrastructure** for Planetary Party events
- Serves as the **flagship hub** for the Permatours network and a model for replication
- Receives **flow funding and grants** channeled through Kinship Earth
- Generates **multi-stream revenue** (farm, retreat, venue, lodging, products) that sustains the ecosystem
- Operates a **circular economy** with community tokens that keep value local

## What Makes It Unique

- **Non-speculative land stewardship** -- held in trust, not subject to market speculation
- **Earned equity through contribution** -- stewardship, not just capital, determines participation
- **Anchor Circle governance** -- consent-based, rotating leadership with autonomous nodes
- **Circular economy** with Sol Token (utility) and Voice Token (governance)
- **Open-source blueprint** -- all designs, governance models, and practices shared for replication

## Current Status

**Phase**: Pre-acquisition / Planning
**Location Focus**: Southern Vermont (Brattleboro / Guilford / Putney)
**Existing Documentation**: Extensive -- see [`brands/unified-sanctuaries/`](../../unified-sanctuaries/) for full brand docs including:
- Vision documents and overviews
- Financial models and revenue projections ($1.4M - $4.5M+ annual potential across all pillars)
- Governance structure (Sol Community Land Project)
- Land acquisition criteria and outreach materials
- Website plan and brand identity system
- Full Next.js application

## Scoping Questions to Resolve

### Ecosystem Integration
- [ ] How does Unified Sanctuaries relate to the broader project ecosystem structurally? Is the existing `brands/unified-sanctuaries/` the canonical source, or does this folder become the home?
- [ ] How are event venue bookings coordinated with Planetary Party?
- [ ] What's the Permatours volunteer integration workflow on the ground?
- [ ] How does Kinship Earth funding flow into US operations? Through the trust? Directly to LLCs?

### Land Acquisition (Immediate Priority)
- [ ] Current status of land search?
- [ ] Entity structuring -- CLT (Community Land Trust) status?
- [ ] Capital raise progress and timeline?
- [ ] What can happen before land is acquired? (Community building, planning, programming at other venues)

### Pre-Land Phase Actions
- [ ] Can events and programming begin at temporary/partner venues while land is being acquired?
- [ ] What community-building activities can happen now?
- [ ] How does the team maintain momentum during the acquisition phase?

### Operations
- [ ] Trust and entity structure -- what's been established, what's pending?
- [ ] Team roles and gaps -- who's committed, who's needed?
- [ ] Budget for pre-acquisition phase operations?

## Initial Planning Steps

1. **Consolidate existing documentation** -- ensure the full body of work in `brands/unified-sanctuaries/` is referenced and leveraged, not duplicated
2. **Define the pre-land phase** -- what actions, events, and community-building can happen now
3. **Clarify entity relationships** -- how US trust/LLCs connect to Kinship Earth, Planetary Party, and Permatours legally
4. **Map the integration points** -- specific operational workflows between US and the other three projects
5. **Update the land acquisition strategy** -- current status, next steps, timeline
