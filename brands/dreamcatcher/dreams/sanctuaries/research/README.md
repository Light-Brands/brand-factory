## Research Domains

### 1. Blue Zone Science
The five validated Blue Zones (Sardinia, Okinawa, Ikaria, Nicoya, Martinique) share nine lifestyle factors (Power 9). Genetics account for only 20-30% of longevity; the remaining 70-80% is lifestyle, diet, and social environment. Key findings:
- **Moai** (lifelong social groups) are formed at age 5 in Okinawa -- one documented group averaged 102 years after 97 years together
- **Ikigai** (purpose) adds 7 years to life expectancy
- **Plant-based diets** preserve telomere length (cellular aging biomarker) -- 2024 systematic review confirmed across all Blue Zones
- **Natural movement** integrated into daily life outperforms structured exercise -- March 2025 study in Journal of Population Ageing
- **Community rituals** for stress (kafeneio, Sabbath, wine hour, afternoon nap) are not optional wellness -- they are cultural infrastructure
- **U.S. Blue Zone Projects** across 72 cities: 35% smoking reduction (Albert Lea), cholesterol rates halved (Corry PA), 23% lower obesity (SW Florida)
- **Scientific controversy**: Researcher Saul Newman found data inconsistencies. 2025 validation confirmed four original zones plus Martinique as fifth.

### 2. Intentional Community Success & Failure
- **90%+ failure rate** -- higher than startups
- **#1 cause of failure**: Interpersonal dynamics (not money, land, or skills)
- **#2 cause**: Vague governance ("we'll just do consensus")
- **What works**: Written vision, screening/onboarding, financial commitment, structured governance (sociocracy > naive consensus), communication training (NVC), diverse revenue
- **Enduring examples**: Twin Oaks (57 years), Findhorn (63 years), Auroville (56 years), Kibbutzim (116+ years)
- **Senegal**: Government transitioning 14,000 villages to ecovillages -- largest national-scale initiative worldwide

### 3. Biomimicry & Mycelium Networks
- **Life's Principles** (Janine Benyus): 27 strategies refined by 3.8 billion years of evolution. Key: adapt, self-organize, build from bottom up, waste = food, cooperate, use local resources
- **Mycelium as social model**: Decentralized coordination. No central command. Adaptive restructuring. Resource-sharing based on need. Resilience through redundancy. Communication/signaling across the network
- **Myceloom framework**: "The social infrastructure that enables human communities to achieve collaborative resilience" -- analogous to mycelium enabling forest ecosystems
- **Practical applications**: Urban Mycelium project, Mycelium Fund (New Constellations), Biomimicry Institute urban planning work

### 4. Regenerative Communities
- **Gaviotas, Colombia**: Transformed 10,000 hectares of wet desert into rainforest. Increased local rainfall 10%. Net water supplier. Free housing, meals, schooling. Consensus governance for 40+ years with zero memos or minutes
- **White Oak Pastures, Georgia**: Rotational grazing creates a net carbon sink -- one of the only livestock operations on Earth that absorbs more carbon than it emits
- **Tamera, Portugal**: Water Retention Landscapes reversed desertification. Created year-round springs where only seasonal flow existed. Carbon storage increased 9.4%/year
- **SEKEM, Egypt**: Desert to fertile farmland via biodynamic agriculture. 15,000 farmers converted. UN Champions of the Earth 2024

### 5. The Science of Connection
- **WHO (2025)**: 1 in 6 people worldwide affected by loneliness. First World Health Assembly resolution on social connection (May 2025)
- **Mortality**: Loneliness equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes/day. Reduces life expectancy ~8 years. 50% increased dementia risk. 29% increased heart disease. 32% increased stroke
- **Dunbar's Number**: Brain maintains ~150 stable relationships in fractal layers: ~5 (inner core, 40% of social time), ~15 (sympathy group), ~50 (affinity), ~150 (active network), ~500 (recognition), ~1,500 (known). Social media does NOT expand these limits
- **Neuroscience**: Social exclusion activates same neural pathways as physical pain. Social pain is "more easily reexperienced and longer lasting than physical pain." Lonely brains are literally less rewarded by connection (reduced ventral striatum activity)
- **The Roseto Effect**: Italian-American community had less than half the heart attack rate of surrounding towns despite identical diet, smoking, exercise, and genetics. The difference: multigenerational households, community celebrations, no one ever alone. When Roseto "Americanized," heart attack rates rose to match. Community structure itself is a health intervention
- **Design implications**: Target 50-150 active community members. Nest in fractal layers. Gore-Tex limits 150 per building. Swedish Tax Agency: max 150 per office

### 6. Food Sovereignty
- **Crystal Waters (Australia)**: World's first permaculture village. 80% of land for agriculture/habitat
- **ReGen Village (Netherlands)**: Closed-loop system. Waste feeds livestock or soldier flies; flies feed fish; fish waste fertilizes aquaculture; gardens fertilized by livestock waste. Produces many times more than conventional farms
- **85+ community food forests** in the US: Beacon Food Forest (5 acres, Seattle), Boston Food Forest Coalition (60,000 sqft), Philadelphia Orchard Project (68 orchards, 11,000+ lbs produce/year), Miami-Dade schools (71 schools, 230,000+ bags of produce to students)
- **Picasso Food Forest (Parma, Italy)**: 185+ trees, 200+ plant species on former barren grassland

### 7. Governance Innovations
- **Sociocracy**: Consent-based ("good enough for now, safe enough to try"), circle-structured, double-linked. One housing project transitioned from voting to sociocracy -- within a year, people looked forward to meetings. Used by Buurtzorg (15,000+ employees), Unicorn Grocery (71-member co-op)
- **Holacracy**: Peer-reviewed research: significantly lower busywork, significantly higher appreciation, 90% meeting time decrease. Zappos: mixed results but remaining staff reported higher engagement
- **Consensus-with-unanimity**: Documented failure modes -- gives disproportionate power to blockers, incentivizes lowest-common-denominator decisions, creates meeting fatigue. Many experienced communities are moving to consent-based models
- **Kerala's People's Plan Campaign**: 35 million people in participatory village assemblies. Proved its worth during COVID-19 with overnight community kitchen deployment

### 8. Economic Alternatives
- **Local currencies**: Swiss WIR (62,000 SMEs, 1.2B CHF/year since 1934). BerkShares (400+ retailers, 10M+ spent). TEM Network (Greece: 50 to 800+ members during economic crisis)
- **Time banks**: Japan (125 branches). Core principle: every person's hour is equal
- **Worker cooperatives**: Italy (87% 3-year survival vs 48% for conventional). France (80-90% vs 66%). During 2008 crisis, co-op employment grew 4.2% while other businesses shrank 0.7%. US: 30,000+ co-ops, $660B annual revenue. Mondragon (Spain): 100+ co-ops, tens of thousands of worker-owners
- **Gift economy**: Pirah tribe (Brazil) -- immediate sharing of any abundance. Pacific Northwest potlatch. Free Store Project NYC (17 kiosks, 186 volunteers)

### 9. Health Without Pharma
- **90% of US healthcare spending** treats lifestyle-rooted conditions
- Blue Zone communities achieve extraordinary health through: plant-based diets, natural movement, stress rituals, social networks, purpose, moderate alcohol, community-level environmental design
- **Roseto Effect**: Social cohesion alone halved heart disease -- no medical intervention needed
- **Intergenerational living**: Elders who volunteer with children burn 20% more calories/week, fewer falls, better memory. Children gain emotional regulation and empathy. Humanitas Model (Netherlands): students live in aged care, 30 hrs/month interaction for subsidized housing

### 10. Energy & Resource Autonomy
- **Samso Island (Denmark)**: 100% renewable, carbon-negative (-12 tonnes CO2/person vs +6.2 Danish average). Community-owned. Heating bills dropped 40%
- **Isle of Eigg (Scotland)**: World's first off-grid community electric system (wind, water, solar). 90-95% renewable. 5kW equitable cap per household
- **Gaviotas (Colombia)**: Fuel self-sufficient via biofuel. Solar water heaters installed across Colombia including 5,500-unit apartment complex
- **Hawaiian Ahupua'a system**: Ancient governance organizing communities from mountain peak to ocean reef. Self-sufficient across all climate zones. Communal water management
- **By 2050**: Nearly half of all EU households could produce renewable energy (CE Delft report)

## Rating Framework Landscape

### What Existing Indices Measure

| Index | Measures | Misses |
|-------|----------|--------|
| World Happiness Report | Life satisfaction (Cantril Ladder), GDP, social support, freedom, generosity, corruption | Relational depth, ecology, spirituality, interspecies, food sovereignty |
| Gross National Happiness | 9 domains (psychological, health, time use, education, culture, governance, community, ecology, living standard) | Community-scale dynamics, commons health, interspecies relationship |
| Happy Planet Index | Life expectancy x wellbeing / carbon footprint | Community, culture, spirituality, biodiversity (beyond carbon) |
| OECD Better Life Index | 11 dimensions (housing, income, jobs, community, education, environment, civic, health, satisfaction, safety, work-life) | Only OECD countries. Thin "community" measure. No spiritual/ecological depth |
| Social Progress Index | 57 indicators across needs, wellbeing, opportunity. Excludes GDP | No cultural vitality, spiritual health, community bonds, ecological regeneration |
| Environmental Performance Index | 58 indicators on climate, health, ecosystems across 180 countries | No community relationship with ecosystems. No rights-of-nature. No spiritual dimension |
| Planetary Boundaries | 9 biophysical boundaries (7 of 9 now exceeded) | No social dimension. No community-scale measurement. No indigenous knowledge |
| Doughnut Economics | Social floor (12 dimensions) + ecological ceiling (9 boundaries) | Implementation thin. No spiritual wellbeing, cultural vitality, relational field quality |

### Indigenous Frameworks That Get It Right

| Framework | Origin | Core Insight |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Buen Vivir** (Sumak Kawsay) | Quechua/Aymara (Ecuador, Bolivia) | Nature is a rights-bearing subject. Wellbeing is relational -- individual within community within nature. Rejects endless growth |
| **Ubuntu** | Pan-African | "I am because we are." The self is constituted by relationships. Governance should emerge from community consultation |
| **Te Whare Tapa Wha** | Maori (New Zealand) | Health is a house with four walls: spiritual, mental, physical, family. Land is the foundation. If any wall is weak, the house falls |
| **Kaitiakitanga** | Maori | Guardianship of the natural world. Whenua = both "land" and "placenta" |
| **Aboriginal Custodianship** | Aboriginal Australian | Every element of nature has a designated human guardian. Custodianship is intergenerational |
| **Ikigai** | Okinawan Japanese | Your reason for being. Worth 7 years of life expectancy |

### What Every Index Misses (and the STI Measures)

1. **The relational field** -- the felt sense of belonging, mutual care, genuine trust
2. **Interspecies relationship** -- whether children know the birds, whether the watershed is alive
3. **The sacred as communal** -- shared ceremony, ritual, collective gratitude
4. **Ecological embeddedness** -- relationship with specific watershed, forest, soil
5. **Intergenerational knowledge transfer** -- whether wisdom flows from elders to youth
6. **Commons health** -- shared resources governed well, accessed equitably
7. **Time sovereignty** -- genuine control over one's hours
8. **The aliveness of place** -- whether the pattern of life is becoming more alive or less
9. **Reciprocity and gift economy** -- how much operates on mutual aid vs transaction
10. **Felt safety and belonging** -- whether each person feels genuinely safe to be fully themselves
