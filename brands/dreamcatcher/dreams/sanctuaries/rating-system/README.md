# The Sanctuary Thriving Index (STI)

> A rating system that measures what actually matters -- built from connection outward.

---

## Philosophy

Every major wellbeing index on Earth was designed within the same paradigm: measure the individual, aggregate the data, rank the nations. Even the best ones (Gross National Happiness, Happy Planet Index, Doughnut Economics) treat community as one dimension among many.

The STI inverts this. **Connection is not a dimension. It is the foundation.**

Like Te Whare Tapa Wha (the Maori wellbeing model), where the house falls if any wall is weak, the STI is built as a living structure. Like mycelium networks that sustain entire forests through decentralized resource-sharing, the STI measures the health of the web itself -- not just the nodes.

### Design Principles

1. **Connection-first**: The relational field is the foundation, not an afterthought
2. **Place-based**: Every place has a unique living pattern -- the index measures whether that pattern is becoming more alive or less (Bill Reed, Regenesis)
3. **Sufficiency over maximization**: Inspired by GNH, there is a "enough" threshold -- more beyond it does not count
4. **Nested scales**: Mirrors Dunbar's fractal social layers (~5, ~15, ~50, ~150) and biomimicry's nested modularity
5. **Regenerative, not just sustainable**: Measures whether a community gives back more than it takes
6. **All beings**: Includes interspecies wellbeing and ecological relationship, not just human metrics
7. **Both/and**: Combines quantitative indicators with qualitative, felt-sense assessment
8. **Indigenous wisdom as foundation**: Draws from Buen Vivir, Ubuntu, Te Whare Tapa Wha, Aboriginal custodianship, and ikigai -- not as footnotes but as core architecture

## The Seven Roots

The STI is organized around **seven roots** -- like a tree drawing nourishment from the soil. Each root is essential. If any root is severed, the whole system weakens.

The scoring uses a **0-10 scale per root**, with a total possible score of **70**. But the number is less important than the pattern -- a community scoring 8/8/8/8/8/8/8 (balanced at 56) is healthier than one scoring 10/10/10/2/2/2/2 (lopsided at 38).

### ROOT 1: THE RELATIONAL FIELD (Connection & Belonging)
*"I am because we are" -- Ubuntu*

**Weight: Core (x1.5 multiplier)** -- This root carries extra weight because it is the foundation upon which everything else rests.

What it measures:
- **Social cohesion density**: How deeply are people woven into each other's lives? (Not just "do you have friends" but "would someone notice if you didn't show up today?")
- **Intergenerational integration**: Do elders live among families? Do children know their grandparents' stories? (The Roseto Effect proved this alone can halve heart disease rates)
- **Moai factor**: Do lifelong support groups exist? (Okinawa's moai -- formed at age 5, maintained for 97+ years)
- **Conflict transformation**: Does the community have structured, functional ways to move through disagreement? (NVC, council process, restorative circles)
- **Mutual aid culture**: When someone is in crisis, does the community mobilize without being asked?
- **Felt safety**: Can each person be fully themselves without social penalty?
- **Loneliness prevalence**: What percentage of residents report feeling lonely? (Inverse score -- lower is better)

**Data sources**: Community surveys, ethnographic observation, social network mapping, participation rates in communal activities, elder integration metrics

**Benchmark communities**: Okinawa (moai), Roseto PA (pre-1965), Sardinia (multigenerational households), Kerala (cooperative culture)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Deep, lifelong mutual bonds; no one is invisible; elders woven into daily life; children feel held by the whole community |
| 7-8 | Strong social fabric; most people have reliable support networks; some isolation exists but is addressed |
| 5-6 | Functional but thin connections; people know their neighbors but don't depend on them; elders are somewhat separated |
| 3-4 | Significant isolation; social bonds are transactional; loneliness is common; elders are institutionalized |
| 1-2 | Atomized; people live near each other but not with each other; loneliness epidemic levels |

---

### ROOT 2: LIVING EARTH (Ecological Harmony)
*"The land and the people are connected" -- Maori proverb*

What it measures:
- **Ecological footprint ratio**: Resource consumption vs. biocapacity (Happy Planet Index methodology)
- **Biodiversity health**: Are local species populations stable, growing, or declining? Can residents name local birds, plants, trees?
- **Regenerative impact**: Is the community actively restoring ecosystems? (Gaviotas: planted 8,000 hectares, increased rainfall 10%. Tamera: reversed desertification, created year-round springs)
- **Soil health**: Is topsoil being built or depleted? Carbon content trending up or down?
- **Water cycle integrity**: Are local water sources clean and replenishing? Is the community a net water contributor or consumer?
- **Rights of nature recognition**: Does the governance framework treat ecosystems as rights-bearing? (Ecuador's constitution, NZ's river personhood)
- **Ecological knowledge depth**: How many residents can identify 20+ local plant species? Do children learn land skills?

**Data sources**: Ecological footprint calculators, biodiversity surveys, soil carbon testing, water quality monitoring, ethnobotanical knowledge surveys

**Benchmark communities**: Gaviotas (regenerated rainforest from barren savanna), Aboriginal fire-stick farming (65,000 years of landscape stewardship), Tamera (reversed desertification), SEKEM (desert to fertile farmland)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Net positive ecological impact; ecosystems are measurably healthier because of the community's presence; deep ecological literacy across generations |
| 7-8 | Actively regenerating; biodiversity stable or increasing; residents have functional ecological knowledge |
| 5-6 | Sustainable -- not depleting but not regenerating; some ecological awareness but not embedded in daily life |
| 3-4 | Extractive relationship with land; biodiversity declining; ecological knowledge limited to specialists |
| 1-2 | Actively degrading ecosystems; disconnected from natural systems; ecological illiteracy |

### ROOT 3: NOURISHMENT (Food Sovereignty & Health)
*"Let food be thy medicine" -- attributed to Hippocrates*

What it measures:
- **Food sovereignty**: What percentage of food is grown locally/regionally? (Crystal Waters: 80% of land for agriculture/habitat. ReGen Village: closed-loop food system producing many times more than conventional farms)
- **Diet quality**: Plant-forward, whole-food, seasonal, traditional? (Blue Zone standard: primarily plants, beans daily, meat ~5x/month)
- **Food access equity**: Can every person in the community access nutritious food regardless of economic status?
- **Seed sovereignty**: Does the community save and share seeds? (Twin Oaks' Southern Exposure Seed Exchange)
- **Health outcomes without pharma dependence**: Life expectancy, disease rates, medication usage relative to comparable populations (Blue Zone benchmark: 90% of healthcare spending treats lifestyle-caused conditions)
- **Movement integration**: Is physical activity woven into daily life or confined to gyms? (Blue Zone standard: natural movement through farming, walking, gardening)
- **Stress ecology**: Are there cultural rituals for stress relief? (Ikaria: afternoon nap + kafeneio. Sardinia: daily wine hour. Loma Linda: Sabbath)

**Data sources**: Local food system mapping, dietary surveys, health outcome tracking, medication usage data, food forest/garden inventories

**Benchmark communities**: Blue Zones (all five), Crystal Waters (permaculture village), Beacon Food Forest (5-acre urban food forest), Kerala (cooperative food distribution)

- **Intergenerational knowledge transfer**: Are elders actively teaching? Are young people actively learning traditional skills?
- **Relationship to death and transition**: Is death integrated into community life or hidden away?
- **Creative expression**: Do residents have time and space for art, craft, music, storytelling?
- **Awe and wonder**: Does the environment foster experiences of beauty, vastness, and connection to mystery?

**Data sources**: Purpose/meaning surveys, cultural activity inventories, intergenerational knowledge audits, spiritual practice mapping, arts participation rates

**Benchmark communities**: Bhutan (GNH's cultural resilience domain), Auroville (spiritual aspiration as organizing principle), Damanhur (artistic/spiritual expression), Okinawa (ikigai), Loma Linda (Sabbath)

## Scoring & Classification

### Raw Score Calculation
Each root is scored 0-10. Root 1 (Relational Field) carries a 1.5x multiplier.

**Formula**: (Root1 x 1.5) + Root2 + Root3 + Root4 + Root5 + Root6 + Root7

**Maximum possible score**: 75

### Balance Assessment
Beyond the raw number, the **balance profile** matters. A radar chart showing all seven roots reveals whether a community is holistically thriving or dangerously lopsided.

**Balance bonus**: If all roots score within 2 points of each other, add +5 to the total. Holistic health is worth more than excellence in one dimension.

### Classification Tiers

| Tier | Score Range | Name | Description |
|------|------------|------|-------------|
| I | 65-80 | **Living Sanctuary** | A place where all beings are demonstrably thriving in harmony. The pattern of life is regenerative. Connection is deep, governance is distributed, ecology is healing. These places are medicine for the planet. |
| II | 50-64 | **Emerging Sanctuary** | Strong foundations with clear momentum. Several roots are deeply healthy. Gaps exist but are being actively addressed. These places are on the path. |
| III | 35-49 | **Awakening** | Significant bright spots alongside significant gaps. Some roots are strong, others are weak. The potential is visible but unrealized. |
| IV | 20-34 | **Struggling** | One or two roots may be strong but the overall pattern is one of extraction, disconnection, or imbalance. Change is needed. |
| V | 0-19 | **In Crisis** | The relational field is broken. Ecology is degraded. Governance is captured. Purpose is absent. Urgent intervention needed. |

## Assessment Methodology

### Level 1: Desk Assessment (Remote)
Available data, published research, census data, environmental monitoring, governance documents. Can produce a preliminary score for any community.

### Level 2: Community Self-Assessment
Community members score themselves using guided rubrics for each root. Reveals internal perception and blind spots.

### Level 3: Embedded Assessment
Trained assessors live in the community for 2-4 weeks, participating in daily life, attending governance meetings, mapping social networks, conducting depth interviews. The gold standard.

### Level 4: Longitudinal Tracking
Annual re-assessment to track trajectory. Is the community becoming more alive or less? The direction matters more than the current score.

## The Indicator That Captures Everything

Bill Reed, pioneer of regenerative development, was asked for his favorite indicator of community health. His answer:

> "The teenagers are choosing to stay -- or are moving back to the village."

If young people want to be there, everything else is probably working. If they're leaving, no amount of solar panels or organic farms will save the place.

This is the ultimate validation metric for the entire STI framework.
