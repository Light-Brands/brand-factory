# Global Sanctuary Directory

> A living catalog of communities where thriving is not a theory but a practice.

Assessed against the [Sanctuary Thriving Index](../rating-system/). Scores are preliminary (Level 1: Desk Assessment) and should be refined through community self-assessment and embedded assessment.

## BLUE ZONES

### Sardinia, Italy (Ogliastra/Nuoro Highlands)
**Population**: ~10,000 in Blue Zone villages

**Strengths**: Relational field, nourishment, purpose. **Gaps**: Governance is standard Italian municipal, economics are not particularly cooperative, interspecies consideration is typical Mediterranean pastoral.

---

### Okinawa, Japan (Northern Rural Areas)
**Population**: ~1.4M prefecture (Blue Zone in northern rural areas)
**Highlight**: World's longest-lived women. The moai system -- lifelong social groups formed at age 5. One documented moai averaged 102 years old after 97 years together. Ikigai (purpose) adds 7 years to life expectancy. Diet: sweet potatoes, turmeric, bitter melon, tofu, seaweed.

| 10 | 6 | 8 | 5 | 9 | 5 | 5 | **58** | II - Emerging Sanctuary |

**Strengths**: The moai system is the gold standard for lifelong social bonds. Ikigai culture is deeply embedded. **Warning**: Okinawa dropped to 42nd of 47 Japanese prefectures for life expectancy. American military bases and fast food are destroying what made it special.

## TOP 10 BY STI SCORE (Preliminary)

| Rank | Community | Score | Tier | Standout Root |
|------|-----------|-------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Amazonian Indigenous Peoples | 63.5 | II | All Beings (10), Living Earth (10), Purpose (10) |
| 2 | Gaviotas, Colombia | 62.0 | II | Living Earth (10) |
| 3 | Sardinia Blue Zone | 60.5 | II | Relational Field (9) |
| 4 | Maori (Aotearoa) | 60.0 | II | Purpose (9), All Beings (9) |
| 5 | Twin Oaks, Virginia | 59.0 | II | Balance across all roots |
| 6 | Isle of Eigg, Scotland | 59.0 | II | Shared Power (8), Living Earth (8) |
| 7 | Ikaria, Greece | 59.0 | II | Nourishment (9) |
| 8 | Aboriginal Australians | 58.5 | II | Purpose (10), All Beings (10) |
| 9 | Tamera, Portugal | 58.5 | II | Living Earth (9) |
| 10 | Bhutan | 58.5 | II | Living Earth (9), Purpose (9), All Beings (8) |

**Pattern**: No community on Earth currently scores as a Tier I Living Sanctuary (65+). The highest scores are held by indigenous communities and small-scale regenerative projects. Progressive cities score well on governance and economics but poorly on relational depth and interspecies harmony. The path to Tier I requires integrating indigenous wisdom with modern governance innovation and ecological regeneration.

## The Aliveness Test

Beyond all the numbers, Bill Reed's single indicator:

> **"Are the teenagers choosing to stay -- or moving back?"**

If yes: the place is alive. If no: the numbers don't matter.

---

*This is a living document. Every score should be challenged, refined, and deepened through community self-assessment and embedded assessment. The goal is not to rank places against each other but to illuminate the pattern of what makes life thrive -- and to help every community on Earth move toward it.*
