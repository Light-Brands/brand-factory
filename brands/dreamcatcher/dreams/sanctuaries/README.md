# Sanctuaries

> Where on this planet are all beings actually thriving in harmony?

This dream maps, rates, and connects the most progressive, regenerative, and deeply connected communities on Earth -- cities, countries, ecovillages, indigenous territories, blue zones, and emerging models -- through a rating system that puts **community and connection** at its absolute core.

The goal is not to rank places by GDP, convenience, or lifestyle aesthetics. It is to answer a different question entirely:

**Where are humans living in a way that honors all life?**

## What's Here

### [Rating System](./rating-system/)
The **Sanctuary Thriving Index (STI)** -- a comprehensive rating framework built from the ground up around connection, harmony, and planetary health. Draws from Blue Zone science, indigenous wisdom frameworks (Buen Vivir, Ubuntu, Te Whare Tapa Wha), biomimicry, Doughnut Economics, and the neuroscience of belonging. Designed to measure what every existing index misses.

### [Global Directory](./global-directory/)
A living catalog of 60+ communities, cities, countries, and territories assessed against the STI framework. Organized by category:
- Blue Zones (validated longevity hotspots)
- Ecovillages & Intentional Communities
- Progressive Cities
- Countries Leading in Wellbeing
- Indigenous & Traditional Communities
- Emerging Models

### [Research](./research/)
The deep-dive findings that inform the rating system -- Blue Zone science, governance models that work, the neuroscience of belonging, food sovereignty, economic alternatives, energy autonomy, and what makes communities succeed or fail.

## Why This Matters

- **1 in 6 people worldwide** is affected by loneliness (WHO, 2025)
- Loneliness reduces life expectancy by **8 years** -- equivalent to a lifelong smoking habit
- **90% of U.S. healthcare spending** treats conditions rooted in lifestyle and disconnection
- **7 of 9 planetary boundaries** have been exceeded
- Yet scattered across the globe, communities are proving that a different way of living is not only possible but already working

The sanctuaries are already here. They just need to be found, understood, connected, and amplified.

## The Core Insight

Every framework we studied -- from the World Happiness Report to Gross National Happiness to the Happy Planet Index -- measures pieces of the picture. But none of them measure the thing that matters most:

**The quality of the relational field.**

The felt sense of belonging. The depth of connection between people, between generations, between humans and the living world. Whether children know the names of the birds. Whether elders are woven into daily life. Whether the water is alive. Whether people wake up with purpose.

The Sanctuary Thriving Index is built to measure exactly this.
