# AISI: AI Super Intelligence Ownership & Sovereignty

A dream about owning the intelligence — not renting it. Building toward a future where the AI that serves your mission is fully yours: trained on your knowledge, running on your hardware, answering to your values alone.

## The Core Question

What if you didn't have to depend on OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or anyone else for the intelligence that powers your work? What if you could build a path from where you are today — using their APIs — to full sovereignty over your own AI infrastructure?

## What This Dream Contains

A complete strategic and technical analysis for building a **Sovereign Consulting Intelligence Platform** — a multi-model AI system that starts by aggregating the best external models, progressively trains its own, and ultimately achieves complete independence.

## The Three Phases

**Phase 1 — Aggregator (Months 1-12)**
Use the best AI models via APIs. Build an orchestration layer that routes to the optimal model for each task. Capture everything to build your proprietary knowledge core. Year 1 cost: $166K - $469K.

**Phase 2 — Hybrid (Months 13-24)**
Train your own model on accumulated data. Shift traffic progressively to your owned model. Keep external models for verification and gap-filling. Year 2 cost: $326K - $930K.

**Phase 3 — Sovereign (Months 25-48)**
Primary inference on fully-owned hardware and models. External models become optional. Complete independence achieved. Phase 3 cost: $1.25M - $4.95M.

## Why This Matters

This isn't just about cost optimization. It's about:

- **Ownership** — The intelligence that runs your business belongs to you
- **Sovereignty** — No external entity can cut you off, change terms, or see your data
- **Values alignment** — Your AI is trained on your methodology, your ethics, your worldview
- **Independence** — The path from renting intelligence to owning it entirely

## Status

First complete analysis written. Six supporting documents covering technical architecture, cost analysis, and strategic planning. Ready for review and Phase 1 decision-making.
