# Build vs. Rent: Strategic Cost Comparison

## Sovereign Consulting Intelligence Platform

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 2026

-----

## Executive Summary

This document compares three strategic paths for AI infrastructure:

1. **Rent (API-Only):** Use external AI providers indefinitely
1. **Hybrid:** Combine owned models with API access
1. **Build (Full Sovereignty):** Complete ownership and independence

Each path has distinct cost structures, risk profiles, and strategic implications.

## Break-Even Analysis

### When Does Build Beat Rent?

**At Low Usage (Monthly API ~$10K):**

- Build never breaks even (not enough volume to justify)
- Recommendation: Rent

**At Medium Usage (Monthly API ~$30K):**

- Hybrid breaks even vs. Rent in Year 2
- Build breaks even vs. Rent in Year 5-6
- Recommendation: Hybrid

**At High Usage (Monthly API ~$60K+):**

- Hybrid breaks even vs. Rent in Year 1-2
- Build breaks even vs. Rent in Year 3-4
- Recommendation: Build

### Break-Even Points

|Comparison      |Low Usage|Medium Usage|High Usage |
|----------------|---------|------------|-----------|
|Hybrid vs. Rent |Never    |Month 18-24 |Month 12-15|
|Build vs. Rent  |Never    |Month 60-72 |Month 36-42|
|Build vs. Hybrid|Never    |Month 72+   |Month 48-60|

## Scenario Modeling

### Scenario A: API Prices Drop 50%

(Realistic given historical trends)

**Impact:**

- Rent becomes more attractive
- Break-even for Build extends by 12-18 months
- Hybrid remains competitive due to flexibility

**Recommendation:** Favor Hybrid, delay Build decision

### Scenario B: API Prices Increase 50%

(Possible if demand exceeds supply)

**Impact:**

- Rent becomes painful at scale
- Break-even for Build accelerates by 12-18 months
- Hybrid provides hedge

**Recommendation:** Accelerate Hybrid or Build

### Scenario C: Breakthrough in Open-Source

(E.g., open model matches GPT-4/Claude quality)

**Impact:**

- Self-hosting costs drop dramatically
- Build becomes more attractive
- Hybrid benefits from cheaper inference

**Recommendation:** Accelerate toward self-hosting

### Scenario D: Regulatory Pressure on Data

(E.g., client data cannot leave your infrastructure)

**Impact:**

- Rent becomes non-viable for sensitive clients
- Hybrid or Build become mandatory
- Premium pricing opportunity

**Recommendation:** Fast-track Build for competitive advantage

-----

## Decision Framework

### Choose Rent If:

- Monthly AI spend < $10,000
- Speed to market is critical
- Limited technical team
- Uncertain about long-term AI strategy
- Flexibility to switch providers valued highly

### Choose Hybrid If:

- Monthly AI spend $10,000 - $50,000
- Want to reduce dependency without major capital
- Have some ML engineering capability
- Need to process some sensitive data internally
- Want optionality for future

### Choose Build If:

- Monthly AI spend > $50,000
- Complete data sovereignty required
- Long-term strategic commitment to AI
- Strong ML engineering team
- Competitive differentiation from AI capabilities

-----

## Recommended Path

### For Your Consulting Intelligence Platform

Given:

- 35 current clients (scaling to 100+)
- Desire for eventual sovereignty
- Strategic importance of AI to business model
- Need to differentiate from Big 4

**Recommended Path: Hybrid → Build**

**Rationale:**

1. Start with Hybrid (Year 1-2)
- Immediate capability via APIs
- Begin accumulating training data
- Validate model training approach with lower risk
- Cost: ~$500K-$1.2M
1. Transition to Build (Year 3-4)
- Deploy owned model as primary
- Maintain API access for edge cases
- Achieve near-complete sovereignty
- Additional Cost: ~$1M-$3M

**Total 4-Year Investment: $1.5M - $4.2M**

This path balances:

- Near-term capability and revenue
- Manageable capital deployment
- Progressive de-risking
- Ultimate sovereignty goal
