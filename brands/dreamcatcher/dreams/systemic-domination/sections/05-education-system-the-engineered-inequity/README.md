# Education System – The Engineered Inequity

The education system has long been hailed as the great equalizer, a means for anyone to rise by merit. In reality, formal education (especially in the United States) has been structured in ways that perpetuate social stratification, compliance, and a narrow worldview. Many of the inequities in schooling are not accidental; they are rooted in historical and policy choices that have systematically advantaged some groups while disadvantaging others. The result is an education system that conditions young minds to accept the current order and rarely question the deeper structures of power.

One glaring manifestation is funding disparity by geography. Public schools in wealthy communities often boast gleaming facilities, small class sizes, and ample resources, because they are funded by higher local property taxes. Meanwhile, schools in low-income (often minority-majority) areas struggle with overcrowded classrooms, outdated textbooks, and fewer opportunities, since their tax base is weaker. This built-in inequity means that from early on, children receive different messages about their worth and potential. The affluent student sees abundance and investment in their development; the poor student sees neglect and scarcity. Such inequality is self-perpetuating: lacking advanced courses or experienced teachers, under-resourced schools cannot easily break their students out of poverty. The much-heralded Brown v. Board of Education (1954) may have outlawed de jure segregation, but de facto segregation persists through housing patterns and district zoning, resulting in many schools that are as segregated today as decades ago. This effectively continues a caste-like stratification under the guise of neighborhood schooling.

Moreover, within schools, there are disciplinary and curricular biases that reinforce social hierarchies. Studies show that students of color (particularly Black and Latino youth) face disproportionate suspension, expulsion, and policing on campus, fueling what’s termed the “school-to-prison pipeline.” For example, Black students in the U.S. are several times more likely to be suspended than white students for similar infractions. Such punitive environments foster fear and alienation rather than creativity or critical thinking. Simultaneously, the curriculum itself often presents a one-dimensional narrative: a Eurocentric version of history and culture that marginalizes the contributions and perspectives of non-European peoples. By centering one culture as the default “civilization,” the system subtly conditions students to view the existing power structure (descended largely from Western colonial and industrial powers) as natural and justified. Any alternative narratives – be they Indigenous worldviews, non-Western histories, or critiques of capitalism and imperialism – receive scant attention in standard textbooks.

The design of modern education, influenced by the 19th-century Prussian model, emphasizes obedience, rote learning, and standardized testing. Students learn early that there are right and wrong answers (as determined by authorities), that success means regurgitating approved information, and that questioning fundamental assumptions may hurt one’s grade. This instills a form of intellectual conformity that serves the broader control system: it produces workers and citizens who will follow rules, meet expectations, and not rock the boat. Critical life skills like emotional intelligence, independent inquiry, and spiritual development are rarely cultivated – in fact, they’re often implicitly discouraged. As one core truth suggests, conventional schooling “suppresses emotional intelligence, intuition, and spiritual inquiry,” instead elevating obedience over curiosity and dissociation over embodiment. By keeping education heavily mind-centric and test-centric, the system divorces individuals from their intuitive and bodily knowing, making them easier to lead by external authority.

From the perspective of Sacred Universal Laws, the Law of Right Relationship is again disrupted here: a healthy society would strive to give each child an equitable start and honor the unique genius in each person. Imbalances in educational opportunity – effectively valuing one group of children over another – violate that principle of harmony and mutual respect. Likewise, the Law of Soul Evolution holds that each soul incarnates with the potential to grow and contribute in its own special way; when students are denied equitable education or are pigeonholed by bias, their capacity to evolve and offer their gifts to the collective is hindered. Education, ideally a process of drawing out inner potential, becomes instead a means of sorting and limiting human potential. Interconnection with other systems is evident: the financial elite ensure their neighborhoods (and private schools) have top-notch education, reproducing their power; the media industry benefits from a populace that doesn’t question the narrative; Big Pharma gains when health and nutrition are absent from curricula and children are conditioned into ADHD diagnoses and medications; the prison industry literally gains future inmates via harsh school discipline. Even militarism seeps into education via JROTC programs or military recruiters targeting underprivileged schools. Thus, the education system does not stand alone – it feeds and is fed by the other structures of domination.

In response, grassroots movements push for reform: culturally responsive teaching, restorative justice discipline (instead of zero-tolerance), desegregation efforts, and holistic education models. Homeschooling and unschooling movements have also grown, as some families seek to escape the standard indoctrination and nurture their children’s fuller capacities. These represent efforts to realign education with truth and soul. A truly liberating education would emphasize critical thinking, self-knowledge, creativity, and spiritual literacy (the development of character, empathy, and awareness) – empowering individuals to question and transcend the other oppressive systems described in this paper.
