Modern governments are often presented as instruments of the people’s will, but in reality they frequently serve powerful interests. Studies of U.S. policy over decades show that affluent individuals and business groups have vastly more influence on government policy than average citizensdiscovery.princeton.edu. In fact, the preferences of ordinary people have “no discernible, independent effect” on policymaking, according to political researchersdiscovery.princeton.edu. This suggests that the democratic process has been skewed to favor an elite minority, undermining the principle of popular sovereignty. Political parties and elections give the public an appearance of choice, yet key decisions often align with what wealthy donors and lobbyists want, not the average voter’s needs. The result is a system that maintains the status quo and concentrates power at the top, rather than truly responding to the majority.

Government structures and laws have been shaped to reinforce this elite control. Money inundates the political process – for example, in 2022 the pharmaceutical industry alone spent a record $372 million lobbying Congress and federal agencies (more than any other industry)deseret.com. Such enormous financial leverage buys access and influence, from writing regulations to tilting legislation in favor of corporate profit. In one case, lobbyists from a major bank literally drafted provisions of a 2014 budget bill to roll back financial regulations – lawmakers copied 70 of 85 lines of the bank’s model legislation into lawrepresent.us. Government officials often cycle through a “revolving door” to lucrative lobbying jobs, further blurring the line between public service and private gain. All these practices ensure policy outcomes that protect entrenched interests (tax loopholes for the rich, subsidies for big industries, weak consumer protections) at the expense of the public. In sum, modern government, rather than being a neutral referee, supports the distortion by giving disproportionate power to economic elites, managing public perception through propaganda, and sidelining any reforms that would threaten the current power structure.
