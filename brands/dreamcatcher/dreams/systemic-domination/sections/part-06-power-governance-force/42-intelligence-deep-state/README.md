# The Intelligence & Deep State Apparatus -- Power Beyond Democratic Oversight

## Content

In 1975, the Church Committee -- a Senate investigation led by Senator Frank Church -- exposed decades of illegal intelligence activities: domestic surveillance of hundreds of thousands of Americans, assassination plots against foreign leaders, drug experiments on unwitting subjects, and infiltration of media, academic, and religious institutions. The CIA director at the time, William Colby, called it the "year of intelligence." The reforms that followed have been systematically rolled back.

**Key mechanisms of control:**

- **COINTELPRO (1956-1971).** The FBI's Counter Intelligence Program targeted Martin Luther King Jr. (sending him a letter urging suicide), the Black Panther Party (assassinating Fred Hampton in his bed), anti-war movements, feminist organizations, and Native American activists. The stated goal was to "expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize" domestic political organizations.
- **Operation Mockingbird.** CIA recruitment of American journalists and media organizations to serve as propaganda assets. Carl Bernstein's 1977 Rolling Stone investigation identified over 400 American journalists who had carried out assignments for the CIA. The full scope remains classified.
- **Operation Paperclip.** The US government recruited over 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians -- many of them former Nazis -- after World War II, whitewashing their records to bypass immigration restrictions. Wernher von Braun, who used slave labor from concentration camps, became the father of NASA's space program.
- **Black budgets.** The US intelligence community's "black budget" was approximately $80 billion in 2023 -- money spent with virtually no public oversight on programs the public is not allowed to know exist. This is taxation without representation in its purest form.
- **Whistleblower persecution.** Edward Snowden revealed mass unconstitutional surveillance and was charged under the Espionage Act. Chelsea Manning was imprisoned for exposing war crimes documented on video. Daniel Hale was imprisoned for revealing that 90% of drone strike casualties in one period were not the intended targets. The message is clear: exposing government crimes is treated as a greater crime than committing them.
- **Five Eyes and global surveillance.** The intelligence-sharing alliance between the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand allows each nation to circumvent domestic surveillance restrictions by having allies spy on their citizens and share the data.
