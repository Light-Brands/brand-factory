# The Military-Industrial Complex -- Perpetual War as Economic Engine

_Part of the [Systemic Domination](../../../README.md) thesis._

## Content

On January 17, 1961, President Dwight Eisenhower -- a five-star general who led the D-Day invasion -- used his farewell address to warn the nation about "the acquisition of unwarranted influence" by the military-industrial complex. His warning has been systematically ignored.

The United States spends more on defense than the next ten nations combined -- over $886 billion in fiscal year 2024. The top five defense contractors (Lockheed Martin, RTX, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, General Dynamics) received over $150 billion in federal contracts in 2023. Their lobbyists walk the halls of Congress. Their former executives sit in the Pentagon. Their board members rotate into government and back again.

**Key mechanisms of control:**

- **Perpetual war economy.** The US has been at war for over 225 of its 248 years of existence. War is not a failure of the system -- it is the system working as designed. Every bomb dropped is a purchase order fulfilled.
- **The revolving door.** Lloyd Austin went from the board of Raytheon to Secretary of Defense. Mark Esper went from Raytheon's VP of Government Relations to Secretary of Defense. This is not the exception; it is the pattern.
- **Arms sales to authoritarian regimes.** The US is the world's largest arms exporter, selling weapons to Saudi Arabia (used in Yemen, creating the world's worst humanitarian crisis), Israel, Egypt, and dozens of other nations regardless of human rights records.
- **Regime change operations.** Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), Chile (1973), Libya (2011) -- the documented history of US-sponsored coups and interventions numbers in the dozens. Each one destabilizes regions for decades.
- **Veterans as disposable.** An estimated 17 veterans die by suicide each day. Over 37,000 veterans are homeless on any given night. The system that sends them to war discards them when they return.
- **Militarization of domestic police.** The 1033 Program has transferred over $7.4 billion in military equipment to local police departments -- armored vehicles, grenade launchers, bayonets. Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 looked like a war zone because the police were equipped like an occupying army.
