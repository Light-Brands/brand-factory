### The Ledger That Was Never Settled

In the Congo Free State, between 1885 and 1908, an estimated ten million people died so that King Leopold II of Belgium could harvest rubber. Soldiers were issued quotas. When a village failed to meet its quota, hands were cut off -- men's hands, women's hands, children's hands -- and delivered to officers as proof of enforcement. Baskets of severed hands became a form of currency. Leopold never set foot in the Congo. He ran the operation from Brussels, where the profits built palaces, funded monuments, and earned him the reputation of a great philanthropist. When international pressure finally forced Belgium to annex the colony in 1908, Leopold burned the Congo Free State archives. "I will give them my Congo," he said, "but they have no right to know what I did there."

This is not ancient history. This is the foundational logic of the system still operating today. In 2021, ground-penetrating radar revealed the remains of 215 children buried in unmarked graves at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia. In the months that followed, over 1,300 more unmarked graves were identified at former residential school sites across Canada. As of 2024, fourteen African nations still deposit fifty percent of their foreign exchange reserves in the French Treasury under the terms of the CFA franc agreements first imposed in 1945. The Democratic Republic of Congo -- Leopold's former colony -- holds an estimated twenty-four trillion dollars in mineral resources. Its people are among the poorest on Earth. The cobalt mined by children in the DRC powers the batteries in smartphones manufactured by the wealthiest corporations in human history.

The ledger between colonizer and colonized has never been settled. It has not even been accurately tallied. What follows is an attempt to map the architecture -- past and present -- through which colonialism operates not as a concluded historical chapter but as the active, evolving, and deeply embedded operating system of global power.

### The Architecture: From Direct Rule to Structural Control

The original colonial project, conventionally dated from 1492 to the formal decolonization movements of the 1960s, was organized around three simultaneous objectives: the extraction of material resources, the exploitation of labor, and the destruction of indigenous cultural systems that might organize resistance. The Spanish extracted an estimated 181 tons of gold and 16,000 tons of silver from the Americas between 1500 and 1650. The British East India Company, at its height, commanded a private army twice the size of the British military and controlled the economic output of the entire Indian subcontinent. The transatlantic slave trade forcibly transported an estimated 12.5 million Africans to the Americas over four centuries, generating the foundational capital upon which Western industrial economies were built. None of this wealth was returned. None of this labor was compensated. The entire project operated on the legal and moral framework that certain categories of human beings were not fully human and that their lands, bodies, and knowledge were legitimate objects of appropriation.

The legal architecture for this project was not improvised. It was formally codified. In 1452, Pope Nicholas V issued the papal bull _Dum Diversas_, authorizing the King of Portugal to "invade, search out, capture, vanquish, and subdue" all non-Christians, to "reduce their persons to perpetual slavery," and to "take all their possessions and property." The 1493 bull _Inter Caetera_, issued by Pope Alexander VI, divided the entire non-Christian world between Spain and Portugal. These documents became the legal foundation for what is known as the Doctrine of Discovery -- the principle that Christian European nations held a right of sovereignty over lands they "discovered," regardless of existing habitation. This doctrine was not a medieval relic that faded with the Renaissance. It was cited by the United States Supreme Court in the 1823 case _Johnson v. M'Intosh_, in which Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that indigenous peoples held only a right of occupancy, not ownership, to their ancestral lands. The doctrine was cited again as recently as 2005, in _City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York_, where Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg invoked the concept in a footnote. The Vatican did not formally repudiate the Doctrine of Discovery until March 2023 -- five hundred and seventy-one years after it was first issued.

When direct colonial rule became politically untenable in the aftermath of two World Wars, the architecture did not dissolve. It evolved. The transition from colonialism to neo-colonialism -- a term coined by Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of independent Ghana -- replaced the colonial governor with the structural adjustment program, the gunboat with the trade agreement, the plantation with the multinational extraction contract. The form changed. The direction of wealth flow did not.

The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, both established in 1944 at the Bretton Woods conference -- where forty-four nations were represented but the vast majority of the world's colonized peoples had no seat -- became the primary instruments of this new architecture. Structural Adjustment Programs, imposed as conditions for emergency lending beginning in the 1980s, required debtor nations to privatize state-owned enterprises, deregulate markets, cut social spending, remove trade barriers, and orient their economies toward export production. Thirty-six sub-Saharan African nations underwent structural adjustment between 1980 and 1999. The results were consistent and devastating: public health systems gutted, education budgets slashed, domestic industries destroyed by foreign competition, food sovereignty replaced by cash-crop dependency, and national debt loads that grew rather than shrank under the weight of compound interest. Zambia's per-capita income in 2000, after two decades of structural adjustment, was lower than at independence in 1964. The IMF's own Independent Evaluation Office would later acknowledge that the programs had caused "ichable harm" to vulnerable populations. The lending continued.

The CFA franc system represents perhaps the most transparent ongoing mechanism of monetary colonialism. Created by France in 1945, the system requires fourteen West and Central African nations to peg their currencies to the euro (formerly the French franc) and deposit fifty percent of their foreign exchange reserves in the French Treasury. France holds a veto over the monetary policy of these nations. The countries using the CFA franc cannot devalue their own currencies to respond to economic shocks, cannot access their own reserves without French approval, and operate within a monetary framework designed to facilitate the extraction of raw materials by French corporations. When the president of Chad, Idriss Deby, publicly questioned the arrangement in 2015, calling it "a drag on African development," he was not the first African leader to do so. Many who challenged French monetary control in the decades after independence did not survive the challenge.

Beyond financial architecture, neo-colonialism maintains itself through military presence. The United States operates more than 750 military bases in over 80 countries. France maintains permanent military installations across its former African colonies. These are not defensive positions. They are the enforcement infrastructure of an economic order. When nations attempt to exit the architecture -- nationalizing resources, rejecting trade terms, building alternative alliances -- the pattern of response is well documented. Iran in 1953: the CIA and MI6 overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh after he nationalized Iranian oil. Guatemala in 1954: the CIA organized a coup against President Jacobo Arbenz after he implemented land reform that threatened the United Fruit Company's holdings. Chile in 1973: the CIA supported the military coup that overthrew Salvador Allende, the democratically elected socialist president, and installed the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Libya in 2011: NATO intervention led to the overthrow and killing of Muammar Gaddafi, who had been working to establish a gold-backed African currency that would have challenged both the CFA franc and the petrodollar system. The message across seven decades is consistent: sovereignty is permitted only within the boundaries set by the existing order.

Then there is the ledger of cultural destruction -- the dimension of colonialism that targeted not just land and labor but identity itself. In the United States, the federal government operated or funded more than 350 Indian boarding schools between 1869 and the 1960s, designed under the explicit policy articulated by Captain Richard Henry Pratt: "Kill the Indian, save the man." Children were forcibly removed from their families, often transported hundreds of miles away, forbidden from speaking their languages or practicing their ceremonies, subjected to physical and sexual abuse, and in thousands of cases, never returned. The Department of the Interior's 2022 investigative report identified burial sites at more than fifty former school locations and acknowledged that the true number is likely far higher. In Canada, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission documented over 4,100 deaths in the residential school system, with the last school closing in 1996 -- not 1896. In Australia, the Stolen Generations policies removed Aboriginal children from their families through the 1970s. These were not educational programs. They were infrastructure for the destruction of cultural continuity, targeting children specifically because they were the living vessels through which language, ceremony, law, and identity were transmitted.

The linguistic dimension of this destruction is ongoing and measurable. A language dies approximately every fourteen days. Of the roughly seven thousand languages currently spoken on Earth, nearly half are endangered. When a language dies, it does not merely take a vocabulary with it. It takes an entire epistemological framework -- a way of categorizing reality, encoding ecological knowledge, expressing relationships, and transmitting spiritual understanding that may have no equivalent in any surviving language. Colonial languages were not passively adopted. They were imposed through education systems that punished indigenous language use, through legal systems that operated exclusively in the colonial tongue, through economic systems that required fluency in the colonizer's language for any form of advancement. Today, English and French remain the official languages of government, commerce, and education across most of Africa -- not because these languages serve African populations best, but because the colonial infrastructure of communication was never dismantled.

### Key Mechanisms of Control

- **The Doctrine of Discovery.** A papal legal framework from the 1400s that declared Christian European nations had sovereignty over any lands they "discovered." Cited in US Supreme Court rulings as recently as 2005. Not formally repudiated by the Vatican until 2023. The legal foundation upon which all colonial land theft was justified and upon which much indigenous dispossession continues to rest.

- **Structural Adjustment Programs.** IMF and World Bank conditioned loans requiring debtor nations to privatize public services, slash social spending, deregulate markets, and open economies to foreign capital. Thirty-six sub-Saharan African nations underwent these programs. The consistent result: increased poverty, destroyed domestic industry, and debt loads that grew rather than shrank.

- **Currency Control.** The CFA franc system requires fourteen African nations to deposit fifty percent of foreign reserves in the French Treasury and grants France veto power over their monetary policy. Dollar hegemony forces global oil trade through US currency, giving the United States effective control over the world's energy markets and the ability to weaponize sanctions.

- **Cultural Genocide.** Residential and boarding schools in the US, Canada, and Australia designed explicitly to destroy indigenous cultural transmission. Over 350 US schools, the last Canadian school closing in 1996, mass graves still being discovered. The targeting of children as the carriers of cultural continuity.

- **Resource Extraction.** The DRC holds $24 trillion in mineral resources while its people live in poverty. Niger provides thirty-five percent of the uranium that powers French nuclear reactors while most of its population lacks electricity. Wealth flows from South to North; poverty remains.

- **Military Base Network.** Over 750 US military bases in 80+ countries, French bases across former African colonies. Not defensive infrastructure but the enforcement mechanism of an economic order. Nations that challenge the arrangement face sanctions, coups, or intervention.

- **Regime Change.** Iran 1953, Guatemala 1954, Congo 1961, Chile 1973, Libya 2011. The documented pattern: when democratically elected governments pursue policies that threaten colonial or neo-colonial interests -- nationalizing resources, implementing land reform, creating alternative currencies -- they are overthrown.

- **Trade Agreement Architecture.** "Free trade" agreements that require developing nations to open markets to subsidized goods from wealthy nations while those same wealthy nations maintain agricultural subsidies, tariffs, and intellectual property regimes that protect their own industries. The rules are written by the winners.

- **Aid as Control.** Development aid that comes with conditions requiring adoption of donor-preferred policies, purchase of donor-country goods, and alignment with donor strategic interests. Aid dependency replaces self-determination. The charity-industrial complex manages poverty without resolving it.

- **Historical Erasure.** Colonial history taught as "exploration" and "discovery." The Doctrine of Discovery presented as legal precedent rather than theological justification for genocide. The wealth of Western nations presented as the product of innovation and hard work rather than centuries of extraction. Textbooks that skip from slavery to civil rights as though the intervening century of Jim Crow, convict leasing, and redlining did not happen.

### The Colonized Mind

Colonialism's most enduring achievement is not the extraction of resources or the drawing of borders. It is the colonization of consciousness itself. Frantz Fanon, the Martinique-born psychiatrist who joined the Algerian revolution, described this phenomenon in _Black Skin, White Masks_ (1952) and _The Wretched of the Earth_ (1961): the colonized person internalizes the colonizer's framework, learning to see their own culture as inferior, their own features as ugly, their own knowledge as primitive, their own language as inadequate. The hierarchy installed by the colonizer does not require ongoing enforcement once it has been internalized. It reproduces itself through the aspirations of the colonized -- the desire to speak the colonizer's language, wear the colonizer's clothes, adopt the colonizer's religion, and measure success by the colonizer's standards.

This internalization operates at every level. Education systems across the formerly colonized world continue to center European history, European philosophy, European science, and European literature as the default curriculum, while indigenous knowledge traditions are relegated to anthropology courses or folklore studies. The very concept of "development" is measured against a Western template: a nation is "developed" to the extent that it resembles Western industrial economies, regardless of whether those economies are ecologically sustainable, socially equitable, or spiritually nourishing. The white savior complex -- the persistent narrative that the formerly colonized world requires rescue by Western intervention, whether through military humanitarianism, development NGOs, or celebrity charity campaigns -- is the cultural expression of a relationship of domination that has never been structurally altered.

The displacement of indigenous identity extends into the realm of the sacred. Missionary colonialism did not merely convert; it displaced. Across Africa, the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific, indigenous spiritual systems -- systems that encoded ecological knowledge, governed social relationships, maintained connection to land, and transmitted intergenerational wisdom -- were systematically replaced by Christianity, not because the new faith was more true but because it was more useful to the colonial project. A people who believe their land is sacred cannot be easily persuaded to sell it. A people who believe they are sovereign under their own spiritual law cannot be easily governed by foreign legal codes. The destruction of indigenous spirituality was not a byproduct of colonialism. It was a prerequisite.

### Interlocking with Other Systems

Colonialism is not one system among many in the architecture of domination. It is the system that built the architecture. Nearly every other system documented in this thesis either originated within, was shaped by, or continues to be maintained through colonial and neo-colonial structures.

The Financial System and Capitalism (Section 23) are inseparable from colonialism. The Bretton Woods institutions -- the IMF and World Bank -- were designed at a conference where colonized peoples had no meaningful representation, and their structural adjustment programs have functioned as instruments of economic control over formerly colonized nations for decades. Dollar hegemony, the petrodollar system, and the weaponization of sanctions are the current expressions of a financial architecture designed to maintain wealth flows from the periphery to the center. The Debt System (Section 24) is the mechanism through which this extraction is operationalized: Haiti, the first nation to successfully overthrow slavery, was forced to pay France 150 million gold francs beginning in 1825 -- compensation not to the enslaved but to the enslavers for their "lost property." Haiti did not finish paying this debt until 1947. Economists estimate the total cost, with interest, at over twenty-one billion dollars in current value. This single example encapsulates the logic of colonial debt: the victim pays the perpetrator for the privilege of freedom.

The Education System (Section 14) has served as one of colonialism's primary instruments of cultural destruction and ideological reproduction. Boarding schools and residential schools were designed to sever the transmission of indigenous knowledge. The Eurocentric curricula that persist across the formerly colonized world are the continuing legacy of an educational architecture that defines knowledge itself through a Western lens. When African children study European history as "world history" and encounter their own civilizations only as subjects of European expansion, the colonial ordering of knowledge is reproduced in each generation.

The Catholic Religion (Section 48) provided the theological justification for the entire colonial enterprise. The Doctrine of Discovery originated in papal bulls. Missionary activity was the cultural arm of colonization, preceding, accompanying, and consolidating military conquest across every colonized continent. The destruction of Maya codices, the burning of indigenous sacred sites, the forced baptisms and forced conversions -- these were not incidental to colonialism but constitutive of it. The Suppression of Sacred Science (Section 49) and the Destruction of Indigenous Wisdom Systems (Section 50) are both downstream consequences of a colonial project that could not permit the survival of knowledge systems that contradicted its claims of civilizational superiority. When indigenous pharmacology, astronomy, agricultural science, and governance systems are destroyed or dismissed, the narrative that the colonizer brought "progress" to the colonized is easier to maintain.

Ecocide (Section 32) follows colonial geography with devastating precision. The most ecologically devastated regions on Earth are the most heavily colonized. Extractive industries strip colonized lands of minerals, timber, and fossil fuels while exporting the wealth and leaving behind contaminated water, depleted soil, and displaced communities. The Niger Delta, the Amazon, the tar sands of Alberta on Indigenous treaty land -- these are not coincidental overlaps but the direct continuation of the colonial extraction model.

Language and Word Manipulation (Section 18) is central to the colonial project. Colonial languages replacing indigenous ones is not merely a communication shift -- it is an epistemological coup. The Sacred Feminine Technologies (Section 47) were specifically targeted because matrilineal societies, women's governance roles, and feminine ceremonial traditions represented social structures incompatible with the patriarchal hierarchies colonizers sought to impose. The Military-Industrial Complex (Section 41) provides the ongoing enforcement infrastructure for neo-colonial economic arrangements, with over 750 US bases serving as the physical manifestation of a global order maintained by force. Modern Government (Section 38) conducts foreign policy that is, in many respects, neo-colonialism by other means -- from sanctions regimes to diplomatic pressure to "nation-building" projects that install governments amenable to Western interests. The Global South Perspective (Section 60) and Counter-Movements and Resistance (Section 57) document both the ongoing reality of colonial structures and the decolonial movements -- from land back to reparations to South-South cooperation -- that represent alternatives to the colonial order.

### Sacred Laws Violated

Colonialism violates more Sacred Laws simultaneously than perhaps any other system documented in this thesis, because it operates across every dimension of human existence -- material, cultural, spiritual, ecological, and relational.

The Law of Collective Stewardship is violated at civilizational scale: entire continents' land, water, minerals, and biological resources were claimed as the property of colonizing powers and have never been returned. The enclosure of the global commons -- from the original land seizures to modern mineral extraction contracts -- is the colonial model, updated but unaltered. The Law of Living Memory is violated through the deliberate targeting of cultural transmission: residential schools, forced assimilation, language death, and the burning of indigenous texts and sacred sites are all acts designed to sever the chain of intergenerational knowledge that carries identity across time. When children are punished for speaking their own languages, the attack is not on communication but on memory itself.

The Law of Right Relationship is the law most fundamentally broken by colonialism, because the entire system is built on the conversion of relationship into extraction. There is no reciprocity in the colonial model -- only taking. Lands are stripped, labor is exploited, knowledge is appropriated, and what flows back is debt, dependency, and cultural displacement. The Law of Free Will is violated through the imposition of foreign governance systems, foreign legal codes, foreign religions, and foreign economic structures on peoples who did not choose them and were not consulted. Consent was never sought because the colonial framework did not recognize the colonized as beings capable of granting or withholding consent. The Law of Interdependence is violated through the severing of communities from their land, their traditions, their languages, and their networks of mutual support -- the very relationships through which human beings sustain themselves and each other.

## Open Questions

- What would genuine decolonization of the global financial system require -- and is it possible without the dismantling of the Bretton Woods institutions?
- How do reparations function not merely as financial transfer but as the restoration of right relationship, and what models (Caribbean Community reparations framework, Tulsa, Evanston) offer viable precedent?
- To what extent has the discourse of "decolonization" itself been co-opted by institutions that benefit from the colonial order -- and how do we distinguish performative decolonization from structural change?
- What is the relationship between land back movements and ecological restoration -- and does the evidence support the claim that indigenous land management produces better ecological outcomes than state or private management?
- How does the ongoing consolidation of global power through trade agreements, debt instruments, and military alliances represent a third phase of colonialism beyond even neo-colonialism -- and what would we call it?
