# Colonialism & Neo-Colonialism -- The Largest System of Domination in Human History

_Part of the [Systemic Domination](../../../README.md) thesis._

---

## Content

The thesis mentions colonialism in passing -- in the religion section (missionary activity), education (Eurocentric curricula), and financial system (IMF/World Bank). But colonialism is not a sub-point of other systems. It is perhaps the largest and most enduring system of domination in human history, and its structures are not historical artifacts -- they are operating now.

**Key mechanisms of control:**

- **Cultural genocide.** In the US, over 350 government-funded boarding schools forcibly removed Native American children from their families between 1869 and the 1960s. The motto was "Kill the Indian, save the man." In Canada, the last residential school closed in 1996. In Australia, the Stolen Generations continued until the 1970s. Mass graves are still being discovered.
- **Language death.** A language dies every 14 days. Of the estimated 7,000 languages spoken today, nearly half are endangered. When a language dies, an entire worldview -- thousands of years of accumulated knowledge about ecology, medicine, astronomy, and philosophy -- dies with it.
- **The Doctrine of Discovery.** Papal bulls from the 1400s declared that Christian European nations could claim lands "discovered" by their explorers -- i.e., lands already inhabited by non-Christians. This doctrine was cited in US Supreme Court decisions as recently as 2005 (City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation). It was only formally repudiated by the Vatican in 2023.
- **Structural adjustment programs.** The IMF and World Bank condition loans to developing nations on "structural reforms" -- privatizing public services, cutting social spending, opening markets to foreign corporations. These programs have devastated economies across Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia while enriching creditor nations.
- **The CFA franc system.** Fourteen African nations still use currencies pegged to the euro (formerly the French franc) and are required to deposit 50% of their foreign exchange reserves in the French Treasury. This is ongoing economic colonialism.
- **Resource extraction.** The Democratic Republic of Congo holds an estimated $24 trillion in mineral resources. Its people are among the poorest on Earth. Cobalt mined by child laborers in the DRC ends up in every smartphone and electric vehicle battery. This is the colonial model, updated.
