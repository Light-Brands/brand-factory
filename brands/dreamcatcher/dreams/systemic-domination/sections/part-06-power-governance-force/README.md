# Part 6: Power, Governance & Force

_Part of the [Systemic Domination](../../README.md) thesis._

## Theme

**"This is who holds the levers."**

The previous parts mapped what is captured — body, mind, labor, earth. This part names who does the capturing and how they maintain their grip. Government serves the elite. Church legitimizes the state. The criminal justice system warehouses the poor. The military enforces abroad what the police enforce at home. Intelligence agencies operate beyond oversight. Colonial structures persist under new names. Nuclear weapons hold the planet hostage. And at the apex sit the architects themselves — the bloodline dynasties and ritual power networks that coordinate the whole machine.

## Reader Journey

The reader now meets the power behind the systems. Modern government is an oligarchy in democratic clothing. Church and state collaborate to govern both body and soul. The prison system is slavery's legal successor. The military-industrial complex runs on perpetual war. Intelligence agencies operate in the dark. Colonialism never ended — it rebranded. Nuclear weapons ensure compliance through existential threat. And at the top sit the architects: dynastic families and secret networks that coordinate across sectors, guarding their position through ritual, secrecy, and generational entrenchment. By the end of Part 6, the reader understands: *The systems are not leaderless. There are architects, and they have names, addresses, and self-preservation strategies.*
