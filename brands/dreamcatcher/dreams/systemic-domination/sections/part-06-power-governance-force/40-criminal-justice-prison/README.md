# The Criminal Justice & Prison Industrial Complex -- Architecture of Mass Incarceration

_Part of the [Systemic Domination](../../../README.md) thesis._

## Content

The United States holds 4% of the world's population and 25% of its prisoners. This is not an accident of crime rates -- it is architecture.

The 13th Amendment abolished slavery "except as a punishment for crime," and the prison system has exploited that exception ever since. For-profit prison corporations (CoreCivic, GEO Group) trade on the stock exchange, their revenue dependent on keeping beds full. They spend millions lobbying for harsher sentencing laws -- mandatory minimums, three-strikes legislation, truth-in-sentencing -- that guarantee a steady supply of inmates. In 2016, the Department of Justice announced it would phase out private prisons; the industry's stock prices crashed. The decision was reversed within months.

**Key mechanisms of control:**

- **The War on Drugs as racial control.** John Ehrlichman, Nixon's domestic policy chief, admitted in a 1994 interview: "We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or Black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and Blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities." Black Americans are 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana than white Americans despite similar usage rates.
- **The bail system criminalizes poverty.** Roughly 470,000 people sit in US jails on any given day who have not been convicted of a crime -- they simply cannot afford bail. Kalief Browder spent three years on Rikers Island (two in solitary) for allegedly stealing a backpack. He was never convicted. He died by suicide at 22.
- **Plea bargaining as coercion.** 97% of federal cases and 94% of state cases never go to trial. Prosecutors stack charges to terrify defendants into accepting plea deals, regardless of guilt. The Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial has been effectively hollowed out.
- **Prison labor as modern slavery.** Inmates produce goods and services for major corporations at wages of $0.23 to $1.15 per hour. This is not rehabilitation -- it is a labor force that cannot unionize, cannot strike, and cannot leave.
- **Recidivism by design.** Criminal records follow people permanently, blocking employment, housing, voting rights, and education. Two-thirds of released prisoners are rearrested within three years. The system is designed to recapture.
- **Criminalization of poverty and homelessness.** Anti-camping ordinances, loitering laws, and fines for sleeping in public turn the condition of being poor into a criminal offense.

- Financial System & Capitalism (Section 23) -- prison labor profits, commissary price gouging, post-release economic barriers
- Modern Government (Section 38) -- lobbying by private prison corporations, judicial appointments
- Mass Programming (Section 19) -- the social trauma of mass incarceration on families and communities
- Media (Section 15) -- crime TV normalizing surveillance and dehumanizing the accused
- I vs We Mentality (Section 54) -- "they deserve it" mentality preventing solidarity with the incarcerated
