# Part 1: Foundations

_Part of the [Systemic Domination](../../README.md) thesis._

---

## Theme

**"Here's how to see the architecture."**

Before naming any single system of control, we must first establish the framework for seeing the whole. This part provides the lens, the timeline, the mechanics of reproduction, and the felt human experience of living inside the architecture. Without foundations, the rest is a list. With them, it becomes a map.

## Reader Journey

The reader begins here with the question: *What am I looking at?* By the end of Part 1, they should have the vocabulary, the historical context, and the visceral recognition needed to navigate the remaining seven parts. The introduction frames the thesis. The timeline reveals that the architecture was built deliberately across centuries. The reproduction analysis shows why it persists. The phenomenology section makes it personal — because this is not abstract. It is your Monday morning. It is your Sunday night dread. It is the thing you can feel but have never been given words for.
