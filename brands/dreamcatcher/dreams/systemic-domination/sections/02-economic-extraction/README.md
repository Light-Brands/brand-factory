## The Premise

Wage stagnation vs. productivity. The financialization of everything. How wealth flows upward by design — not accident. Housing as speculation. Debt as control. The death of the middle class as a feature, not a bug.

- Debt as a mechanism of control — student, medical, consumer, mortgage
- The death of the middle class as a feature, not a bug
- Stock buybacks vs. worker investment
- The concentration of wealth — how the top 0.1% separated from everyone else
- How inflation hits differently depending on class
- The designed fragility of living paycheck to paycheck

## Connections

- **Political Capture:** Wealth buys political access; political access protects wealth
- **Healthcare as a Profit Engine:** Medical debt as economic weapon
- **Education — Defunded by Design:** Student debt as an economic leash on an entire generation
- **Labor & the War on Workers:** Wage suppression is the engine of upward wealth transfer
- **The Culture Machine:** The American Dream narrative obscures the extraction
