# The Culture Machine

_Part of the [Systemic Domination](../../README.md) thesis._

## The Premise

Individualism as ideology. The American Dream as sedative. Meritocracy myth. How culture is manufactured to keep people blaming themselves instead of the systems. Distraction as governance.

---

## Threads to Pull

- Individualism as ideology — how "personal responsibility" became a shield for systemic failure
- The American Dream as sedative — the story that keeps people running on the treadmill
- The meritocracy myth — the belief that outcomes reflect effort, not access
- How culture is manufactured to keep people blaming themselves instead of the systems
- Distraction as governance — bread and circuses, updated for the algorithm age
- Consumerism as identity — you are what you buy
- The weaponization of patriotism — dissent as disloyalty
- How entertainment normalizes wealth, power, and inequality
- The self-help industrial complex — selling solutions to systemic problems as personal development
- How culture creates the emotional infrastructure that makes all other systems possible
