## Content

The psychiatric system carries a history that most of its practitioners would prefer to leave unexamined. From the era of lobotomies and forced sterilization through decades of involuntary institutionalization, the mental health apparatus has served as a mechanism of social control long before it became a mechanism of pharmaceutical profit. Involuntary commitment laws still allow the state to confine individuals who have committed no crime, stripping them of bodily autonomy based on clinical judgments that remain irreducibly subjective. The Rosenhan experiment of 1973 laid bare the fragility of these judgments: eight healthy volunteers presented themselves at psychiatric hospitals claiming to hear a single word, were admitted with diagnoses of schizophrenia, and despite immediately ceasing all pretense of symptoms, none were detected as imposters by staff. Their stays ranged from seven to fifty-two days. If the system cannot distinguish the sane from the insane, the question becomes not whether it is effective but whom it serves.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has expanded from 106 disorders in its 1952 first edition to over 300 in its current form, a trajectory that reflects not the discovery of new diseases but the progressive pathologization of the human condition. Grief, once understood as a natural and necessary process, became eligible for clinical diagnosis when the DSM-5 removed the bereavement exclusion from major depressive disorder, opening the door to medicating people for the act of mourning their dead. Childhood energy and curiosity are reframed as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and treated with stimulant medications that would be classified as controlled substances if prescribed to adults without a diagnosis. The historical persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals through conversion therapy, electroshock, and institutionalization demonstrates how the psychiatric system has reliably pathologized whatever the dominant culture finds threatening or inconvenient. Homosexuality was listed as a mental disorder in the DSM until 1973, removed not through new scientific evidence but through political organizing by the very people it was used to oppress.

Today, one in six Americans takes psychiatric medication, a statistic that raises a fundamental question: is the population sick, or is the system designed to make healthy responses to an unhealthy world appear as illness? Neurodiversity advocates argue that conditions like autism and ADHD represent natural human variation rather than disorders requiring correction, and that the pressure to pathologize difference serves the interests of a society that demands conformity over authenticity. Thomas Szasz's critique that "mental illness" functions primarily as a tool of social control remains uncomfortable precisely because the evidence continues to support it. The carceral dimension of mental health is not historical but ongoing: psychiatric holds, court-ordered medication, and the funneling of people in mental health crisis into jails rather than care facilities all demonstrate that the system's default relationship to psychological suffering is containment, not liberation.
