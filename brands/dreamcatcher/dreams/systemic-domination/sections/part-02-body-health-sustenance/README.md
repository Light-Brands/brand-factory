# Part 2: Body, Health & Sustenance

_Part of the [Systemic Domination](../../README.md) thesis._

## Theme

**"They've captured your biology."**

The most intimate domain of control is the body itself. What you eat, how you heal, what substances you are permitted to consume, and how your biological urges are engineered — these are not personal choices made in a vacuum. They are choices made inside a system designed to profit from your sickness, your cravings, and your dependence. This part maps the architecture of bodily capture.

## Reader Journey

After understanding the framework (Part 1), the reader confronts what is closest: their own body. The pharmaceutical system manufactures dependency on drugs while suppressing alternatives and ignoring nutrition. Insurance gates access to care. Sacred plant medicines that could heal are criminalized. The food supply engineers addiction. Factory farming poisons the chain. Biotech rewrites the blueprint. Addiction is designed across every domain. Mental health is carceralized. And beauty standards ensure you never feel whole enough to stop consuming. By the end of Part 2, the reader understands: *My body is not my own — it has been colonized by systems that profit from keeping me unwell.*
