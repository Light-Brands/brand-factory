Poster from the 1936 propaganda film Reefer Madness, which sensationalized marijuana as "Public Enemy No. 1." The distortion extends into how society has viewed sacred plant medicines like cannabis and psychedelic mushrooms. Once revered in traditional cultures for their healing and consciousness-expanding properties, these natural substances were aggressively demonized in the 20th century. In the United States, cannabis (hemp/marijuana) was targeted by racially-charged propaganda in the 1930s. The first U.S. drug czar, Harry Anslinger, stoked fear by claiming that cannabis caused "insanity, criminality and death," and he infamously linked it to violent crimes by racial minoritiescharlatan.ca. Sensational media like Reefer Madness (1936) portrayed marijuana as a menace to society, leading to its nationwide prohibition. This campaign was less about science -- early on, even the American Medical Association disputed Anslinger's claims -- and more about social control and protecting corporate interests (nylon, timber, and pharmaceutical competitors to hemp and cannabis). Demonizing cannabis helped justify laws that punished its use for decades, discouraging research into its medical benefits and casting a long shadow of stigma. Only in recent years has the narrative begun to shift, as scientific studies and patient experiences forced acknowledgement that cannabis has significant medicinal value (for pain, epilepsy, PTSD, etc.) and is far less harmful than initially claimed.

Psychedelic mushrooms (psilocybin) and related plant medicines faced a similar arc. In the 1950s and 60s, psychedelics were studied by psychiatrists and showed great promise as therapies for depression, addiction, and trauma. But by the late 1960s, a moral panic and the War on Drugs halted all that. Prohibitive legislation in the mid-1960s effectively ended all major psychedelic research programspmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Substances like psilocybin and LSD were classified as Schedule I (having "no medical use"), and for decades they were available only in underground or indigenous contexts. The potential of these "sacred mushrooms" -- long used by traditional healers for spiritual insight and mental healing -- was buried under fearmongering about hallucinations and societal chaos. This hardline stance persisted even as legal substances like alcohol and tobacco (arguably more harmful) remained widely used. Critics argue that the suppression of psychedelics was partly ideological (a reaction against 1960s counterculture and a desire to prevent people from "expanding their minds" outside accepted norms) and partly economic (no way to patent a wild mushroom). By demonizing these natural tools, the authorities maintained social conformity and the dominance of pharmaceutical solutions.

Now, a renaissance is underway: since the 1990s, controlled studies have resumed and shown that psychedelic plant medicines can dramatically improve mental health when used responsibly (e.g. relieving depression or end-of-life anxiety). Likewise, cannabis is being legalized and recognized for its therapeutic benefits. The very substances once vilified as dangerous have proven to be among the most profound healers -- calling into question the motives behind their earlier prohibition. The truth revealed is that the war on these "sacred plants" was never about public safety alone; it also served to uphold certain power structures and profit models. Keeping such plants illegal supported a distortion in which lab-made pills were the only sanctioned medicines, and any naturally growing alternatives (no matter how effective) were cast into the shadows.
