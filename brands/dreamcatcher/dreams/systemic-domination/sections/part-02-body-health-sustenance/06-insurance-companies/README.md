# Insurance Companies -- Gatekeepers of Healthcare Access

## Content

In tandem with Big Pharma, the health insurance industry acts as a gatekeeper that determines who can receive care, when, and of what kind. In principle, insurance is meant to protect individuals from catastrophic medical costs; in practice, it has become another control mechanism, often prioritizing corporate profits over patient well-being. In the United States, major insurers like UnitedHealth Group, Anthem, Aetna, Cigna, and Humana dominate the market. These companies exert enormous influence over healthcare policy through lobbying and political donations, helping shape legislation in their favor -- for example, by resisting reforms that would cut administrative costs or regulate premium hikes.

One way insurers reinforce manufactured dependency is by denying or approving treatments based on cost rather than efficacy. It is estimated that nearly 1 in 5 in-network medical claims are denied by insurers on average kff.org, often leaving patients to forgo necessary treatments or pay out-of-pocket. Such denials illustrate how insurers routinely prioritize profit over care: expensive procedures or novel therapies might be rejected as "not medically necessary" simply because covering them hurts the company's bottom line. Patients can be left in life-threatening limbo or incur crushing debt when an insurer refuses to pay for a surgery, specialist, or medication. Indeed, medical expenses are a leading cause of personal bankruptcy in America, implicated in roughly 60% of filings abi.org. This financial precarity instills fear and compliance -- sick individuals often feel they cannot afford to question the system that doles out coverage.

Insurance bureaucracies also create layers of delay and stress through complex rules and paperwork. The endless prior authorizations, claims forms, and fine-print exclusions not only postpone care (sometimes dangerously), but psychologically condition people to accept that obtaining healing is an arduous privilege, not a human right. Doctors, for their part, face pressure to alter treatment plans to fit what insurance will approve. For example, a physician might prescribe a less effective drug because it's on the "formulary" (approved list), or discharge a patient sooner than is ideal because additional hospital days won't be covered. In these ways, insurers indirectly dictate medical decisions, tightening control over both providers and patients. A person's very health choices (surgery vs. rehab, generic vs. brand drug, etc.) are funneled into paths profitable to the insurer.

By commodifying care, the insurance system distorts the Law of Compassionate Service, which in higher spiritual terms means that true service to others should be given with empathy and without ulterior motive. When access to healing is made contingent on one's employment benefits, bank account, or ability to navigate red tape, compassion is compromised. A harmonious society would treat the sick with generosity and concern; our current system instead measures their worthiness by actuarial tables. There is also a violation of the Law of Right Relationship between healer and healed: rather than a partnership of trust, the imbalance of power (insurer over patient) creates an atmosphere of antagonism and anxiety. Patients often feel powerless and disrespected -- a far cry from the mutual respect that should characterize healthcare relationships.

Psychologically, this reinforces a sense of helplessness and dependence. People internalize that staying healthy is extremely complicated and costly, best left to large institutions. Spiritually, it engenders fear -- fear of falling ill and being bankrupted, fear of claims being denied, fear of one's own body. A populace living in such fear is less likely to take risks, challenge authorities, or seek alternative paths to wellness. Thus, the insurance industry's gatekeeping role works hand-in-glove with Big Pharma: expensive lifetime drug regimens are acceptable because insurance might pay; alternative or preventive therapies (nutrition, holistic modalities) are sidelined because they are often not covered. Together they maintain a feedback loop of monetized illness.
