# The Architects of the System – Elite Control and Self-Preservation

All the distortions we’ve examined – in government, medicine, economy, culture, and religion – ultimately point back to the influence of a small elite that holds disproportionate power. These elites may be high-ranking politicians, corporate titans, billionaires, or legacy aristocracies; often, they are an interconnected network across business and government (the “establishment”). Over time, they have engineered society’s systems to protect and enrich themselves above all. Consider the distribution of wealth: the top 1% of humanity has captured astonishingly large gains, especially in recent years. Since 2020, the richest 1% of people amassed nearly two-thirds of all new wealth created – about $26 trillion – while the other 99% of the world’s population had to split the remaining one-thirdmedium.com. This is not a temporary fluke but a result of long-standing trends. The wealthy have used their resources to tilt policies in their favor: tax codes full of loopholes for capital owners, trade deals that favor multinational corporations, weak labor protections that keep wages down, and so on. Modern democracies have, in effect, been transformed into plutocracies (rule by the rich). As noted earlier, a Princeton study concluded that the average citizen’s wishes have virtually no impact on policy compared to the influence of economic elites and lobbyistsdiscovery.princeton.edu. In blunt terms, we live in an oligarchy wearing democratic trappings.

This elite class not only accumulates wealth, but actively uses its power to entrench its position. One way is through control of information and narrative. A handful of billionaires own or fund major media outlets, think tanks, and social media platforms, helping shape public opinion in ways that align with their interests. For instance, media consolidation means a few corporate owners can decide which news is amplified or ignored, often subtly ensuring that the status quo is not seriously challenged. Another method is the use of legal and financial architecture: The ultra-rich hide their fortunes in offshore tax havens – by some estimates, at least $8.7 trillion of individual wealth is stashed secretively overseasimf.org – depriving governments of revenue that could be used to uplift the masses. They also benefit from complex corporate structures and lobbying that allow them to evade accountability (e.g., banks deemed “too big to fail” receive bailouts during crises, while ordinary folks lose homes and jobs). The rules of the game – from intellectual property law to international banking regulations – are often written by and for these elites. It’s a form of self-protection baked into the system: economic downturns that devastate working people barely dent a billionaire’s portfolio, and if they do, emergency measures (like central bank interventions or stimulus packages) often prioritize stabilizing markets and corporations, thereby rescuing the elite’s assets first.

Throughout history, elites have also mastered the tactic of divide and conquer. By fomenting division among the general population (be it along racial, ethnic, religious, or partisan lines), they prevent unified rebellion. When people are busy blaming each other or fighting over scraps, they have less energy to question why a tiny group is hoarding most of the wealth and power. This is why you’ll often see public discourse stirred up around cultural issues or identity conflicts, while economic inequalities remain unaddressed. It’s a distraction that serves the powerful. The “I vs We” mentality discussed earlier is a prime example: encourage hyper-individualism and people won’t form strong collective movements that could threaten elite interests. Even the suppression of certain knowledge (like financial education or historical truths) can be viewed as a way to keep people from gaining the insight to challenge their overlords. The elite control is so pervasive that it becomes invisible – it’s just “how things are.” But occasionally, events pull back the curtain: for example, when massive scandals or crashes happen (Wall Street meltdowns, corporate frauds, etc.), we see how a tight club of insiders rigged the game and, usually, how they escape largely unscathed. As the saying goes, “banks got bailed out, people got sold out.”

In summary, the entire system has been architected or at least co-opted by an elite class to secure its own dominance. From the halls of government to the boardrooms of big companies, from the universities (funded to produce certain ideologies) to the global institutions (like the IMF or World Bank often pushing policies favorable to capital), their fingerprints are on everything. They have distorted reality – promoting narratives that justify their privilege (“anyone can make it, if you failed it’s your fault”) – and hidden or attacked truths that would empower the masses. Understanding this is key to unravelling the distortions: it’s not random that each of these systems we’ve discussed is misaligned with public interest. They are interlocking gears of a machine built to preserve the power and wealth of a few. The hopeful flip side is that what humans created, humans can change – but only if we first see the architecture clearly and then work collectively (we instead of I) to redesign it in the interest of truth, fairness, and the common good.
