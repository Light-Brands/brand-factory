# Financial Ignorance by Design – No Education on Money

It is no accident that basic financial education is absent in most schools. Despite money being “the most valuable tool on the planet” for navigating life, generations have grown up with zero formal instruction on how banking, credit, investment, or even personal budgeting works. Many have questioned this glaring omission. Author Robert Kiyosaki recounts asking his teacher why schools never teach about money, and being told: “Because the government doesn’t let us teach that subject – government tells us what we can teach and what we can’t. ”indianexpress.com In Kiyosaki’s view, “School is designed to teach you to be an employee, but never about money.”indianexpress.com This provocative claim hints at an intentional design: keeping the general population financially illiterate ensures a compliant workforce and consumer base. People educated only to earn wages – and not how to make wages work for them – are more easily trapped in debt and dependency. They become lifelong customers for loans, credit cards, and financial services they barely understand.

Concrete facts underscore the financial literacy crisis. As of mid-2020s, surveys show financial literacy in the US hovers around only 50% – meaning roughly half of adults cannot confidently grasp basic concepts like interest rates, inflation, or risk diversificationweforum.orgweforum.org. This is not surprising when one considers that for decades, the majority of American high schools did not require any personal finance class. (Only 27 U.S. states currently mandate a standalone personal finance course for high school graduation, and in many places students can still graduate without ever learning how to manage a checking account or save for retirementramseysolutions.com.) The outcome is that most young adults enter the world clueless about money management. In one survey, 88% of U.S. adults said high school did not leave them fully prepared to handle personal financesazquotes.comindianexpress.com. They learn by painful trial and error – racking up credit card debt, misusing student loans, falling prey to predatory lenders, or failing to invest for the future. This widespread ignorance doesn’t just happen; it benefits the system. Banks and credit card companies earn billions in interest and fees from financially unsavvy customers. Employers benefit from workers who, lacking investment knowledge or assets, remain dependent on each paycheck (and thus less likely to quit or strike). The distortion is clear: by not empowering people with financial literacy, the education system effectively maintains an economic order where wealth stays concentrated among those who do understand money (the financial elite). The good news is that awareness is growing – several states have recently added personal finance requirements, and there’s a push to make financial literacy universal. But for now, the legacy of “intentional ignorance” persists, and countless individuals are paying the price in poor financial decisions.
