## Content

30. Mass Farming of Beef, Pork, Dairy and Poultry and the sickness that is those industries and the terrible conditions our livestock have to endure as a result of just being our food.

31. Clothing by design to be all fake materials (cheap as possible society mentality) and plastic which is so unnatural for us and even harming our body.

32. Everything created with a focus on cheap as possible without focusing on quality, we’re destroying true craftsmanship by the crap we are producing at bottom dollar and a society that is conditioned to buy things that preserve their capital as much as possible

33.  We’re able to put a man on the moon but we are unable to solve plastics in our ocean?  Climate change?  Healthier food supplies?  Innovate better, more sustainable solutions?  We are the smartest species on the planet and everything we create is at the detriment of earth's precious resources.  It’s hard to believe this is not intentional.
