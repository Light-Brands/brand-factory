# Sacred Laws Glossary

_A reference document for the [Systemic Domination](../../../README.md) thesis._

---

## Purpose

This glossary catalogs the Sacred Universal Laws referenced throughout the thesis. Each law is defined and mapped to the sections where its violation or distortion is documented. This serves as both a reference tool and a lens through which the architecture of domination can be understood as a systematic inversion of natural spiritual principles.
