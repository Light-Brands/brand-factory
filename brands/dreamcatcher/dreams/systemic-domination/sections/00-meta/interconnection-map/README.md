# Systems Interconnection Map

_A reference document for the [Systemic Domination](../../../README.md) thesis._

---

## Purpose

This document will map the web of connections between all 60 systems documented in the thesis. Where System A feeds System B feeds System C, those feedback loops are documented here. The goal is to transform the thesis from a catalog of individual systems into a visible network — showing how the architecture holds together and where its structural vulnerabilities lie.

---

## The Web

_Each system's connections will be mapped here as the individual section "Connections" fields are populated._

### Feedback Loops

_Circular dependencies where systems reinforce each other._

-
-
-

### Chokepoints

_Systems that, if disrupted, would cascade across multiple other systems._

-
-
-

### Load-Bearing Walls

_The systems without which the architecture cannot stand._

-
-

## How to Read This

- Start with any system and follow its connections outward
- Look for clusters — groups of systems that form tight feedback loops
- Identify the chokepoints — these are where liberation efforts may have the most leverage
