# The Taxation & Wealth Extraction System -- Rules Written by Those Who Benefit

## Content

In 2018, Amazon -- then valued at approximately $1 trillion -- paid $0 in federal income tax. That same year, a schoolteacher earning $40,000 paid an effective federal tax rate of roughly 12%. The tax system is not broken. It is working precisely as designed -- by and for the people who write the code.

**Key mechanisms of control:**

- **Regressive taxation.** Sales taxes, payroll taxes, and property taxes hit lower-income people hardest as a percentage of income. A billionaire and a janitor pay the same sales tax on groceries. The janitor feels it. The billionaire does not.
- **Corporate tax avoidance.** Apple held $252 billion offshore in 2017. Google routes profits through Ireland, the Netherlands, and Bermuda (the "Double Irish Dutch Sandwich"). Amazon has used accelerated depreciation, stock-based compensation deductions, and R&D credits to reduce its effective tax rate to near zero in multiple years. These are not loopholes -- they are features written by corporate lobbyists.
- **The offshore system.** The Panama Papers (2016) and Paradise Papers (2017) revealed that the world's wealthiest individuals and corporations hide an estimated $32+ trillion in offshore tax havens -- the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Luxembourg, Switzerland. This is more than the GDP of the US and China combined.
- **IRS enforcement disparity.** ProPublica reporting revealed that the IRS audits the lowest-income Americans (those claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit) at roughly the same rate as the top 1%. Wealthy taxpayers hire attorneys and accountants who make audits expensive and time-consuming. Congress has cut the IRS budget repeatedly, making enforcement against the wealthy effectively impossible.
- **The tax preparation lobby.** Intuit (TurboTax) and H&R Block have spent millions lobbying Congress to prevent the IRS from offering free, simplified tax filing -- something most wealthy nations provide to their citizens. Complexity is profit.
- **Dynastic wealth transfer.** The stepped-up basis loophole allows inherited assets to be valued at their current market price rather than their original purchase price, erasing billions in capital gains taxes every generation. This is how wealth dynasties perpetuate themselves.
