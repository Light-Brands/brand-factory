# Part 4: Economy, Labor & Material World

_Part of the [Systemic Domination](../../README.md) thesis._

---

## Theme

**"They've captured your time and resources."**

Body captured. Mind captured. Now: your labor, your money, your time on earth. The systems in this part extract wealth upward through financial architecture, debt bondage, taxation designed by the rich, labor structures that consume your life, and housing turned into speculation. Even knowledge itself is enclosed. Even charity is a control mechanism. Even the quality of what you buy is degraded by design. This part maps the material extraction layer of the architecture.

## Reader Journey

The reader now sees how the architecture extracts. The financial system concentrates wealth by design. Debt is the mechanism of bondage — from student loans to sovereign debt. Taxation is written by the wealthy for the wealthy. Labor consumes your life while returning less and less. Housing — a biological necessity — becomes a speculative instrument. Knowledge is enclosed behind paywalls and patents. Charity launders reputations while preserving inequality. Even the objects you buy are degraded: craftsmanship destroyed, natural materials replaced with synthetics. By the end of Part 4, the reader understands: *My economic life is not a meritocracy. It is an extraction system that takes my time, my labor, and my resources and channels them upward.*
