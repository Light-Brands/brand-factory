# The Housing & Shelter System -- When Home Becomes a Financial Instrument

_Part of the [Systemic Domination](../../../README.md) thesis._

## Content

Shelter is a biological necessity as fundamental as food and water. The system has turned it into a speculative financial instrument.

In the United States, institutional investors purchased approximately 1 in 4 single-family homes sold in some markets during 2021-2022. BlackRock, Invitation Homes, and American Homes 4 Rent own hundreds of thousands of single-family rentals. A generation that watched the 2008 housing crisis destroy their parents' wealth now cannot afford to buy homes because those homes are being purchased by the same financial institutions that caused the crisis.

**Key mechanisms of control:**

- **Redlining and its legacy.** The Home Owners' Loan Corporation created color-coded maps in the 1930s designating Black neighborhoods as "hazardous" (red). Banks refused to lend there. The practice was outlawed in 1968 but its effects persist: 3 out of 4 neighborhoods redlined in the 1930s remain low-income today. Modern algorithmic lending reproduces these patterns.
- **Zoning as segregation.** Single-family zoning laws -- first implemented in Berkeley, California in 1916 -- effectively exclude lower-income people from wealthy neighborhoods. They are the legal architecture of class and racial segregation.
- **Homelessness as policy choice.** Finland reduced homelessness by 35% using a "Housing First" model -- providing homes unconditionally, then addressing other issues. The US instead criminalizes homelessness, spending more on enforcement than it would cost to house people.
- **The 2008 crisis and predatory lending.** Banks knowingly sold subprime mortgages to people who could not afford them, then packaged those mortgages into securities and sold them to investors. When the house of cards collapsed, the banks were bailed out. Ten million families lost their homes. Almost no one went to prison.
- **Property tax funding schools.** This creates a vicious cycle: wealthy neighborhoods have well-funded schools, which attract more wealth, which raises property values, which funds better schools. Poor neighborhoods get the opposite. Housing policy is education policy is class reproduction.
