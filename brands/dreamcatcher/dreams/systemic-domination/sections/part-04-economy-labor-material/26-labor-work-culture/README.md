# The Labor & Work Culture System -- Extracting Maximum Value from Human Life

## Content

In 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted that by 2030, technological progress would allow a 15-hour work week. Productivity has increased over 400% since then. Instead of working less, Americans work more -- and for stagnating wages.

Between 1979 and 2020, worker productivity increased by 61.8%, while hourly compensation rose only 17.5% (Economic Policy Institute). The difference went to shareholders and executives. CEO-to-worker pay ratio has grown from 21:1 in 1965 to 399:1 in 2021. Work is not designed to serve human flourishing -- it is designed to extract maximum value from human labor while returning the minimum necessary to keep people showing up.

**Key mechanisms of control:**

- **The 40-hour week as containment.** The standard work week plus commuting consumes 50-60 hours. Add sleep and basic maintenance, and there is little time left for civic engagement, community building, creative expression, or questioning the system. This is not incidental -- it is functional.
- **Healthcare tied to employment (US-specific).** Approximately 157 million Americans receive health insurance through their employer. Losing your job means losing your healthcare. This creates a coercive dependency that prevents people from leaving bad jobs, starting businesses, or taking risks. No other wealthy nation does this.
- **The gig economy.** Companies like Uber, DoorDash, and Amazon Flex have reclassified employees as "independent contractors," stripping away benefits, protections, and labor rights won over a century of organizing. They call it "flexibility." Workers call it precarity.
- **Anti-union warfare.** Amazon spent $14.2 million on anti-union consultants in 2022 alone. Starbucks fired over 200 union organizers (NLRB complaints filed). Walmart closed an entire store in Quebec rather than negotiate with a newly formed union. "Right to work" laws in 27 states allow workers to benefit from union contracts without paying dues, systematically defunding organized labor.
- **Bullshit jobs.** Anthropologist David Graeber documented the proliferation of meaningless administrative, managerial, and bureaucratic roles that serve no productive purpose but keep people busy and compliant. A 2015 YouGov poll found 37% of British workers believed their job made no meaningful contribution to the world.
- **The myth of meritocracy.** The belief that hard work leads to success obscures the reality that zip code, race, and parental wealth are far stronger predictors of economic outcome. Meritocracy is the story the system tells to make its victims blame themselves.
