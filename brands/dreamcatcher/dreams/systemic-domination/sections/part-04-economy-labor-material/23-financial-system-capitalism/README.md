### I. The Architecture of Economic Inequality

While media and culture shape minds, the financial system shapes material realities and possibilities. The global financial architecture -- encompassing banks, stock markets, central banks, and monetary policy -- is often portrayed as a neutral engine for prosperity and capital flow. Yet its structure systematically concentrates wealth and power in the hands of a few, reinforcing a class hierarchy that underpins all other forms of domination. Money, after all, is a universal lever: those who control the purse strings can influence government, education, media, and more. Thus, examining the financial system reveals how economic design keeps the majority in varying degrees of precarity or servitude while a small elite effectively steers the course of society.

A stark indicator of this inequality is wealth concentration. In the United States, the top 1% of households owns more wealth than the bottom 90% combined. Globally, the trend is similar: a handful of billionaires hold as much wealth as the poorest half of humanity. Such disparity did not come about by chance alone; it is the result of policies (tax codes, labor laws, deregulation) crafted over decades under the influence of wealthy interests. Financial deregulation in the late 20th century allowed Wall Street to engage in risky speculation (e.g. derivatives trading) without oversight -- culminating in crises like the 2008 financial meltdown. That crash illustrated how the system's interconnected complexity and lack of accountability could "socialize losses and privatize gains." Banks deemed "too big to fail" gambled with impunity; when their bets went bad, governments (using taxpayer money) bailed them out, while millions of ordinary people lost homes and jobs. This event was not an anomaly but a feature of a system that values corporate balance sheets over individual livelihoods. It also provided a lesson in mass psychological conditioning: despite public outrage, very few bankers faced consequences, subtly teaching that financial elites operate above the law.

**Debt as Enslavement.** Modern economies run on debt -- from credit cards and student loans to national bonds. Debt can be a tool of enslavement when predatory terms and compound interest trap individuals and countries in endless repayment. Many young adults start their working lives tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt, pushing them to take whatever jobs they can to service the loan rather than pursuing their true passions or challenging the status quo. Entire nations in the Global South are similarly indebted to institutions like the IMF or World Bank, often forced to implement austerity measures (cutting social programs, privatizing resources) to obtain refinancing. This "debt diplomacy" extends control of wealthy nations over poorer ones without needing open colonization. On the personal level, the pressure of debt and scarce savings keeps people in survival mode -- less likely to rock the boat at work or in society, for fear of losing the paycheck that keeps their family afloat. Economic insecurity thus breeds compliance.

**Political Power through Finance.** The financial system is intricately tied to political power through campaign finance and lobbying. Major financial institutions (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, etc.) and their executives pour money into elections and policy advocacy. This results in legislation that favors the continuity of their dominance -- low taxes on capital gains (benefiting investors over wage earners), loopholes for offshore tax havens, weak antitrust enforcement allowing ever-larger mergers, and so on. After the 2008 crash, banking regulations were modestly tightened (e.g. Dodd-Frank Act), but within less than a decade, those rules were rolled back under industry pressure. The interchangeability of Wall Street and government officials (Treasury secretaries who hail from Goldman Sachs, etc.) exemplifies a "hidden governance" where elected government often serves as an executive committee for the financial elite's interests.

**Owners and Power Structures.** The owners of finance include not only the big banks but also central banks and international bodies. Central banks (like the U.S. Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank) have enormous influence over economies through interest rate policy and money creation, yet are often technocratic and opaque in operation. The average citizen does not vote on these decisions, yet they determine whether loans are affordable, whether jobs are plentiful, whether currencies inflate (eroding savings). Internationally, groups like the G7, World Bank, and IMF coordinate monetary policies that developing nations must follow to stay in favor. There is also the less-visible network of ultra-wealthy families and funds (the "banking dynasties" -- Rockefellers, Rothschilds, etc.) that have stakes in many industries and sometimes act in concert. Even entities like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street -- ostensibly passive investment firms -- collectively are the top shareholders in an astounding array of corporations, effectively giving a tiny cadre of asset managers cross-industry influence. In a very literal sense, the world's financial capital is controlled by a minute fraction of people, creating a plutocracy beneath the veneer of democratic markets.

### II. Financial Ignorance by Design

It is no accident that basic financial education is absent in most schools. Despite money being "the most valuable tool on the planet" for navigating life, generations have grown up with zero formal instruction on how banking, credit, investment, or even personal budgeting works. Author Robert Kiyosaki recounts asking his teacher why schools never teach about money, and being told: "Because the government doesn't let us teach that subject -- government tells us what we can teach and what we can't" (indianexpress.com). In Kiyosaki's view, "School is designed to teach you to be an employee, but never about money" (indianexpress.com). This provocative claim hints at an intentional design: keeping the general population financially illiterate ensures a compliant workforce and consumer base. People educated only to earn wages -- and not how to make wages work for them -- are more easily trapped in debt and dependency. They become lifelong customers for loans, credit cards, and financial services they barely understand.

Concrete facts underscore the financial literacy crisis. As of the mid-2020s, surveys show financial literacy in the U.S. hovers around only 50% -- meaning roughly half of adults cannot confidently grasp basic concepts like interest rates, inflation, or risk diversification (weforum.org). This is not surprising when one considers that for decades, the majority of American high schools did not require any personal finance class. Only 27 U.S. states currently mandate a standalone personal finance course for high school graduation, and in many places students can still graduate without ever learning how to manage a checking account or save for retirement (ramseysolutions.com). The outcome is that most young adults enter the world clueless about money management. In one survey, 88% of U.S. adults said high school did not leave them fully prepared to handle personal finances (indianexpress.com).

They learn by painful trial and error -- racking up credit card debt, misusing student loans, falling prey to predatory lenders, or failing to invest for the future. This widespread ignorance does not just happen; it benefits the system. Banks and credit card companies earn billions in interest and fees from financially unsavvy customers. Employers benefit from workers who, lacking investment knowledge or assets, remain dependent on each paycheck (and thus less likely to quit or strike). The distortion is clear: by not empowering people with financial literacy, the education system effectively maintains an economic order where wealth stays concentrated among those who do understand money (the financial elite). The good news is that awareness is growing -- several states have recently added personal finance requirements, and there is a push to make financial literacy universal. But for now, the legacy of "intentional ignorance" persists, and countless individuals are paying the price in poor financial decisions.

### III. Corrupt Capitalism -- Profit Over People and Planet

"Corrupt capitalism" refers to a stage of the economic system where everything is driven by the bottom line, to the detriment of human values. In this model, people become products and nature mere input -- all exploited for maximum short-term profit.

**Surveillance Capitalism.** One glaring example is how surveillance capitalism treats personal data: as scholar Shoshana Zuboff observes, tech companies today "unilaterally claim human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data" (goodreads.com). Our thoughts, preferences, and online behaviors are being mined and sold without our genuine consent. This commodification of every aspect of life raises profound ethical issues -- privacy is eroded, and individuals are viewed not as citizens with rights, but as data points to be monetized. If a service is free, you are the product being sold; if labor is cheaper overseas, domestic workers are laid off; if cutting safety corners boosts stock price, the risks to consumers or employees are ignored.

**Environmental Destruction.** This relentless profit-first mentality also explains environmental and social harm on a grand scale. A striking statistic: just 100 companies have been the source of over 70% of the world's industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 (theguardian.com). These are mainly fossil fuel corporations whose business model, unchecked, has driven the climate crisis -- an existential threat to humanity. Yet under corrupt capitalism, such companies long prioritized extracting and selling oil and gas (and lobbying to block climate action) because it was enormously profitable, regardless of the damage to the planet's future. Similarly, food conglomerates advertise addictive, unhealthy foods because it is lucrative, while obesity and diabetes rates surge. In each case, profit is privatized while costs are externalized onto society or the environment. Any attempt to regulate or reduce these harms is met with fierce resistance -- because that might hurt the quarterly earnings.

**Commodification of Everything.** Under this distorted system, human life and dignity become secondary to financial metrics. Workers are often seen as expendable costs: companies will lay off thousands to boost a stock's value, or keep wages stagnant to enrich shareholders, reflecting a calculus that values money over livelihoods. Consumers are treated as targets for perpetual upselling and manipulation -- consider how social media algorithms amplify outrage or anxiety, because keeping us hooked yields more ad revenue. Even democracy is undermined by corporate money ensuring policies favor profit-makers. In sum, corrupt capitalism reduces all interactions to transactions. It has commodified our data, our attention, our health, and even our relationships. The bottom-line-driven mentality supports the grand distortion by normalizing exploitation: as long as it is profitable, it is justified. Not all business is evil and profit motive can drive innovation, but without ethical and societal counterbalances, capitalism left to its own devices tends to devour the very social fabric and natural resources it depends on. Recognizing this truth is the first step to demanding a more responsible, people-centered economy that measures success in more than just dollars.

### IV. Sacred Laws -- The Spiritual Dimension of Economic Domination

The financial system's distortions, compounded by designed ignorance and corrupt capitalism, form a unified violation of sacred principles:

**The Law of Right Relationship** is violated by creating an extreme imbalance in resource distribution, eroding social cohesion and mutual respect. Money, which could be viewed as a form of energy exchange, is hoarded and flowed in ways that do not honor the well-being of the whole. Financial ignorance by design deepens this violation -- when one party to a transaction understands the terms and the other does not, no "right relationship" is possible.

**The Law of Soul Evolution** is suppressed: when individuals are weighed down by poverty or the stress of making ends meet, their opportunity to pursue higher aspirations, creative endeavors, or spiritual growth is significantly hindered. It is hard to meditate on unity consciousness when one is worrying about rent and debt; thus the system keeps many at the lower rungs of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, preoccupied with survival and ego competition.

**The Law of Abundance** in the universe -- the idea that creation is naturally abundant and generous -- is inverted into a narrative of scarcity and competition, which justifies the cutthroat ethos of market capitalism. Corrupt capitalism takes this inversion further, converting every human experience and natural resource into a scarce commodity to be extracted, monetized, and depleted.

**The Law of Free Will** is undermined when financial literacy is deliberately withheld. A choice made in ignorance is not a free choice. The millions who sign predatory loan agreements, rack up credit card debt they do not understand, or accept exploitative working conditions because they see no alternative are not exercising sovereignty -- they are operating within a maze designed to have only one exit.

### V. Alternative Systems and the Path Forward

Despite these heavy constraints, cracks are present. The rise of cryptocurrencies and local currencies is partly a response to mistrust in centralized banking. Movements for debt forgiveness (whether for student loans or for developing nations) challenge the moral legitimacy of binding lives through interest. Growing awareness of wealth inequality has led to calls for systemic change -- from progressive taxation to universal basic income. Several states have recently added personal finance requirements to school curricula, and there is a growing push to make financial literacy universal.

Envisioning a liberated financial system involves a return to seeing money as a tool for mutual benefit rather than domination. Interest-free lending circles, cooperative ownership models, resource-based economies, and B-corporations that measure impact alongside profit are all explorations in aligning economic practice with spiritual values of sharing and sufficiency. The journey to such alternatives requires shedding the deeply ingrained belief that human nature is nothing but selfish and that cutthroat competition is the only driver of progress -- a belief heavily promoted by those who profit from the current architecture.
