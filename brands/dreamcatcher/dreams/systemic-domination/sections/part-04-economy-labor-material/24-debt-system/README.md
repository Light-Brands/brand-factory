# The Debt System -- Money Created as Bondage

## Content

The debt system is not a feature of the economy. It is the economy. Under fractional reserve banking, money itself is created as debt: when a bank issues a loan, it does not lend existing deposits but creates new money through the act of lending, money that exists only as an obligation to repay with interest. This means that the total money supply is always less than the total debt, because the interest owed on every dollar created was never itself created. The system therefore requires perpetual growth, perpetual new borrowing, and perpetual expansion simply to service existing obligations. It is a mathematical certainty that not everyone can repay. Default is not a bug but a structural feature. The Federal Reserve, the institution that presides over this architecture in the United States, was established in 1913 following a secret meeting of the nation's most powerful bankers at Jekyll Island, Georgia. It operates as a quasi-private institution with public authority, its decisions shaping the economic reality of 330 million people while remaining largely insulated from democratic accountability. National debt, framed in political discourse as a problem to be solved, functions in practice as intergenerational bondage, obligating citizens not yet born to service debts they never consented to incur.

The normalization of consumer credit in the post-World War II era transformed debt from a mark of shame into a lifestyle requirement. Credit cards, auto loans, and installment plans were marketed not as obligations but as access, freedom, and participation in the American dream. Today, the consequences of this normalization are staggering. Student loan debt in the United States exceeds $1.7 trillion, burdening an entire generation with obligations incurred before they were old enough to understand compound interest, for degrees whose economic value the market increasingly fails to honor. Medical debt is the number one cause of personal bankruptcy in America, a distinction unique among wealthy nations, meaning that the act of getting sick or injured in the United States can destroy a family's financial existence. The concept of "odious debt" in international law holds that debt incurred by illegitimate regimes should not be binding on the populations those regimes governed, yet the principle is almost never applied, allowing dictator-era debts to shackle nations for generations after the dictators are gone.

The debt collection industry operates as a system of harassment and coercion, purchasing delinquent debts for pennies on the dollar and then pursuing debtors with relentless phone calls, wage garnishments, and legal threats. Modern debtors' prisons exist in all but name: across the United States, people are jailed for unpaid fines and fees, their inability to pay treated as criminal contempt rather than economic reality. The entire architecture of debt serves a single function: to ensure that the population remains in a state of perpetual obligation, working not to build wealth or pursue meaning but to service the interest on money that was conjured from nothing. When the money supply itself requires endless growth to avoid collapse, the result is a civilization locked into an extractive relationship with both its people and its planet, unable to slow down, unable to rest, unable to choose sufficiency over expansion because the math will not allow it.
