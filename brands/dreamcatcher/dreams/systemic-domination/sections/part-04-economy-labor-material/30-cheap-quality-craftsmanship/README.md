# Cheap Quality Over Craftsmanship -- Destroying the Art of Making Things Well

## Content

There was a time when the things humans made were built to last. A piece of furniture was expected to survive generations. Tools were forged to endure decades of daily use. Clothing was constructed with seams and materials meant to withstand years of wear. That era did not end because better alternatives emerged. It ended because a different economic logic took hold: the logic of bottom-dollar production, in which the sole governing metric is cost reduction and the sole governing purpose is margin expansion. The result is a civilization drowning in objects that are designed to be purchased, used briefly, and discarded, each replacement cycle generating another transaction, another unit of GDP, another entry in the ledger of economic growth that measures the volume of consumption without ever asking whether what is consumed has any enduring value. Planned obsolescence, first formalized by the Phoebus cartel's deliberate shortening of lightbulb life in the 1920s, has become the default philosophy of manufacturing. Products are engineered not to serve but to fail, ensuring that the consumer remains a consumer perpetually.

The loss of craftsmanship is not merely an aesthetic decline. It is the destruction of an entire category of human knowledge and an entire mode of human relationship with the material world. Skilled trades that once provided dignified livelihoods, deep expertise, and community identity have been systematically devalued by an economy that prizes speed and volume over quality and durability. A cobbler who could repair shoes for a lifetime has been replaced by a disposable shoe industry that produces 24 billion pairs annually, the vast majority destined for landfills within a year. A local furniture maker who understood wood grain, joinery, and the particular needs of a household has been replaced by flat-pack particle board assembled with Allen keys and discarded at the next move. The knowledge embedded in these trades, accumulated over generations of apprenticeship and practice, is not stored in any database. When the last practitioners retire or are priced out of existence by mass production, the knowledge dies with them.

The conditioning of consumers is the other half of the equation. A population trained from birth to seek the lowest price, to equate value with cheapness, and to treat objects as disposable has lost the capacity to recognize quality, to invest in durability, and to maintain a relationship with the things they own. The fast furniture, fast fashion, and fast everything economy produces not only mountains of waste but a psychological orientation toward the world in which nothing is worth keeping, nothing is worth repairing, and nothing carries the weight of care or craft. This orientation extends beyond objects to relationships, communities, and commitments. When a society teaches its members that everything is replaceable, it should not be surprised when those members treat everything, including each other, as disposable. The destruction of craftsmanship is the destruction of the idea that making something well is a worthy human endeavor, and in its place stands an economy that values nothing except the speed at which value can be extracted and discarded.
