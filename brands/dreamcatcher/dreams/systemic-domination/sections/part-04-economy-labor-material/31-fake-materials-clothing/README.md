# Fake Materials & Synthetic Clothing -- Wrapping the Body in Plastic

## Content

For thousands of years, human beings clothed themselves in materials drawn from the living world: cotton, wool, linen, silk, leather, hemp. These materials breathe, regulate temperature, biodegrade, and exist in relationship with the body as natural extensions of the natural environment. Over the course of a single century, the majority of the world's clothing has been replaced by petroleum-derived synthetics: polyester, nylon, acrylic, spandex, and their blends. Today, over 60% of all clothing produced globally contains polyester, a plastic. The shift was not driven by superior performance or consumer demand. It was driven by cost. Synthetic fibers are cheaper to produce than natural ones, and in an industry governed entirely by the logic of bottom-dollar production, cheaper is the only metric that matters. The result is that most human beings on Earth now wrap their largest organ, their skin, in plastic for the majority of their waking and sleeping hours, absorbing microplastics and chemical additives through dermal contact in a slow, continuous exposure whose long-term health consequences are only beginning to be understood.

The health dimension of synthetic clothing is emerging with increasing urgency. Synthetic fabrics are treated with a range of chemical finishes: formaldehyde resins for wrinkle resistance, PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as "forever chemicals") for stain resistance, azo dyes linked to skin sensitization and potential carcinogenicity, and antimicrobial treatments whose effects on the skin microbiome are unstudied. Unlike natural fibers, synthetics do not breathe, trapping heat and moisture against the skin and creating conditions favorable to bacterial and fungal growth. Every wash cycle releases hundreds of thousands of microplastic fibers into waterways, a pollution stream so pervasive that microplastics have now been found in human blood, breast milk, placentas, and lung tissue. The body is not designed to be encased in petroleum derivatives, and the civilization that has normalized this practice has done so without ever conducting the longitudinal health studies that would reveal its cost.

The fast fashion industry is the delivery system for this transformation. Producing over 100 billion garments per year for a global population of 8 billion, the industry manufactures roughly 12 garments per person per year, the vast majority of which will be worn fewer than ten times before being discarded. The environmental toll is immense: the fashion industry accounts for approximately 10% of global carbon emissions, consumes 93 billion cubic meters of water annually, and sends an estimated 92 million tons of textile waste to landfills each year. Synthetic garments do not biodegrade. They fragment into ever-smaller plastic particles that persist in the environment for hundreds of years. The cheapest-possible mentality that governs production ensures that garment workers in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam, and other manufacturing centers labor under conditions that frequently include wage theft, unsafe buildings, and hours that constitute modern slavery. The Rana Plaza collapse in 2013, which killed over 1,100 garment workers in Bangladesh, briefly illuminated these conditions before the news cycle moved on and the industry continued largely unchanged. The system wraps the body in plastic, poisons the water with microfibers, buries the land in waste, and exploits the labor of the world's poorest workers, all to produce clothing so cheap that it is not worth repairing, so disposable that it is not worth keeping, and so saturated with synthetic chemistry that its true cost is measured not in dollars but in the slow contamination of the human body itself.
