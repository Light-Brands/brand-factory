# Part 3: Mind, Perception & Narrative

_Part of the [Systemic Domination](../../README.md) thesis._

---

## Theme

**"They've captured your attention and thought."**

If Part 2 is about the body, Part 3 is about the mind. The systems here don't poison your food — they poison your perception. They shape what you think, what you believe is true, what you fear, and what you never even consider. From the schools that format your thinking to the media that curate your reality to the language that constrains your imagination, this part maps how the architecture colonizes consciousness itself.

## Reader Journey

The reader moves from the body to the mind. Education formats children into compliant workers. Media curates what reality looks like. Digital systems surveil and sort. Social media harvests attention for profit. Language itself is weaponized. Psychological warfare fragments the ability to think clearly. Fear is engineered as the master control emotion. Children are targeted before they can defend themselves. And the narrative of progress assures everyone that things are getting better, so stop asking questions. By the end of Part 3, the reader understands: *My perception of reality has been manufactured. The thoughts I believe are mine may not be.*
