# Distortion of Masculine and Feminine Energies – The Imbalance of Power

## Content

While the aforementioned systems operate in external domains, there is a more intimate, internalized structure of domination: the distortion of gender energies and roles. At a societal level, this manifests as patriarchy – the privileging of masculine-associated traits and the suppression or devaluation of feminine-associated traits. It is important to note we speak here of “masculine” and “feminine” in a broader energetic sense (active vs. receptive principles, linear vs. cyclical wisdom, etc.), not strictly male vs. female biology. Over centuries, cultures around the world – influenced by religious, economic, and historical forces – constructed rigid gender roles that have limited personal potential and justified unequal power dynamics. Understanding this distortion is crucial, as it underpins many other forms of control: a society out of balance in its masculine/feminine energies is more prone to violence, environmental exploitation, and spiritual disconnection.

In traditional patriarchal structures, men have been expected to embody dominance, rationality, aggression, and emotional stoicism, whereas women are expected to embody submissiveness, nurturing, intuition, and emotional expressiveness – but only within certain confines. These social constructs of gender are not innate truths; they are learned behaviors that vary by culture and era. By asserting that “men are naturally suited to lead” or “women are naturally more caring but less decisive,” these narratives entrenched male dominance in public spheres (politics, business, religion) and relegated female influence to the private sphere (home, child-rearing) – all while disregarding the vast diversity of individual talents and temperaments. The result has been systemic imbalances: women historically denied education, voting rights, property ownership, or positions of authority; men pressured into militant and unfeeling roles under threat of losing their “manhood.”

This imbalance has harmful consequences for all genders. An overemphasis on traditionally “masculine” traits like competition, dominance, and emotional suppression leads to a society that often glorifies aggression and devalues empathy. We see this in workplaces that reward ruthless behavior, or in norms that tell boys not to cry and to solve problems through force. Such conditioning contributes to issues like widespread violence, war-making, and the loneliness epidemic among men who were never taught to process emotions or seek support. Conversely, undervaluing “feminine” traits like compassion, cooperation, and intuition deprives society of healing and community. For instance, qualities of collaboration and caregiving are often not given economic value (consider the underpayment of teachers and nurses, or the unpaid labor of homemaking). The consequence of imbalance is that communities lack strong support systems and holistic thinking – gaps which are often filled by more authoritarian or impersonal structures (like policing or bureaucratic control) rather than mutual aid and understanding.

At an individual level, rigid gender roles can cause people to deny or suppress parts of themselves to fit the mold. A man who is naturally gentle and artistic might feel compelled to adopt a tough persona to gain social acceptance, thereby living inauthentically and suffering internally. A woman with leadership ability might be discouraged or penalized for being “too assertive,” forcing her to either bury her leadership or face social backlash. This stunting of authentic self-expression means fewer people realize their full potential, which is a loss to the collective as well. It also creates identity conflicts and mental health struggles: how many have been made to feel “not man enough” or “not a good woman” due to arbitrary standards, leading to shame and low self-worth?

From a higher perspective, the distortion of gender energies violates the cosmic principle of balance (sometimes referred to in spiritual literature as the harmony of yin and yang, or the Sacred Union of masculine and feminine). The Law of Right Relationship in society is disrupted when one gender or energy dominates the other; true harmony requires equilibrium and mutual respect. Likewise, the Law of Soul Evolution is hampered: souls incarnate with both masculine and feminine aspects to develop, and when constrained by gender role dogmas, their growth is hindered. The persistent undervaluing of the feminine (whether in women or within men’s own psyche) keeps humanity cut off from certain spiritual technologies like deep intuition, empathy, and connection to nature (often associated with the mother/feminine principle). Meanwhile, the hyper-masculine distortion fuels continuous cycles of conquest, extraction, and hierarchical competition that have led us to brink of ecological and moral crises.

It is worth noting that cultural institutions – media, education, and religion – have historically reinforced these gender norms. Textbooks until recently emphasized men’s accomplishments and cast women as side notes. Religions in many cases barred women from priesthood or leadership (to be discussed more in the next section on the Church). Popular culture for decades showed girls as passive princesses or homemakers and boys as bold adventurers or breadwinners (though this is gradually changing). Even economics plays a role: many workplace structures reward long hour competition (harder for those who might prioritize family care) and define success in zero-sum ways (climbing a ladder often built on others’ subordination). All of these send signals that perpetuate the imbalance.

Positive changes are underway. The last century saw monumental shifts – women’s suffrage, feminist movements challenging sexist laws, more fluid explorations of gender identity in younger generations, and an increasing recognition that traits like vulnerability or empathy in leadership are strengths, not weaknesses. Some nations have made strides in women’s representation in government or closing the pay gap. Yet, backlash and regression also occur (e.g. attempts to control women’s reproductive rights, or re-entrench “traditional” gender norms as a political tool). This indicates that the distortion is deeply embedded, and healing it will require more than policy – it requires a collective consciousness shift.

That healing involves embracing a holistic view: that every human being carries both masculine and feminine energies, and the goal is to integrate them into wholeness. It means valuing collaboration alongside competition, intuition alongside intellect, and cooperation alongside leadership. At a practical level, it calls for social arrangements (in workplaces, families, governance) that allow all individuals to express their full range of talents and emotions without stigma. When societies achieve a harmonious dance of these energies – sometimes called a “sacred marriage” of the divine masculine and feminine – they can unlock a higher creative potential and create systems that are just, nurturing, and dynamically progressive.
