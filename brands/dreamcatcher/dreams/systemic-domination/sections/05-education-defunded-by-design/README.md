## Threads to Pull

- The deliberate underfunding of public education — who benefits from an uneducated populace
- Student debt as an economic leash on an entire generation
- The pipeline from school to workforce compliance — education as job training, not liberation
- Critical thinking as a threat to the system
- The privatization agenda — charter schools, vouchers, and the dismantling of public institutions
- How school funding tied to property taxes ensures inequality by design
- The textbook wars — who controls what children learn
- Higher education as a class sorting mechanism
- The adjunctification of universities — exploiting educators while raising tuition
- How education debt delays homeownership, family formation, and wealth building

## Connections

_How does this system feed into or depend on the others?_

- **Economic Extraction:** Student debt feeds the financial system; uneducated workers accept lower wages
- **Political Capture:** An uninformed electorate is easier to manipulate
- **The Culture Machine:** Education shapes (or fails to shape) the ability to see through cultural programming
- **Criminal Justice & Mass Incarceration:** The school-to-prison pipeline is a direct connection
