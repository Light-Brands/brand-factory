# Demonizing Alternative Medicine – Marginalizing Holistic Health

## Content

Alternative and holistic forms of medicine have long been marginalized by the medical establishment, often to the benefit of corporate medicine. A century ago, institutional reforms like the Flexner Report (1910) deliberately shut down many schools of homeopathy, herbalism, and other non-allopathic healing arts, dismissing them as unscientificen.wikipedia.org. This standardization of medical education – heavily funded by industrial philanthropists – established pharmaceutical drug treatment and surgery as the pillars of “modern” medicine while deriding traditional remedies. In the following decades, any practices outside the pharmaceutical/surgical model were often labeled “quackery.” This stigmatization of alternative medicine created a monopoly of sorts for Western allopathic medicine, narrowing the definition of “effective” treatment to those that could be patented and sold.

Behind this demonization lies a profit motive. Many natural or holistic therapies (from acupuncture and herbal supplements to chiropractic care) offer relief but cannot be easily monetized by big corporations. As one observer bluntly noted, pharmaceutical companies make billions from drugs like addictive opioid painkillers – “They don’t want you to know about safer alternatives offered by holistic health care… Alternatives threaten Big Pharma’s bottom line.”drugwatch.com In other words, established interests have financial incentive to discredit or ignore remedies they can’t profit from. Media and medical boards often portray alternative cures as scams while downplaying their successes (or the shortcomings of mainstream drugs). This one-sided narrative supports the distortion by keeping the public dependent on expensive medications and surgeries. It also breeds distrust: people either accept the mainstream solution as the only “real medicine” or swing to unproven cures in rebellion. Lost in the mix is a balanced approach – acknowledging that some alternative modalities (like certain herbal medicines, mind-body techniques, etc.) do have merit and could complement standard care. By demonizing entire fields of healing, the system protects its profits and power, at the cost of potentially healthier, more holistic outcomes for patients.
