To understand the historical roots of gender and spiritual distortions, one must examine the role of organized religion – particularly the Catholic Church in the Western world – in entrenching male dominance and suppressing feminine authority. The Catholic Church, as one of the oldest and most influential institutions on the planet, has shaped societal norms for over a millennium. While it has provided spiritual guidance to billions, it has also propagated an ideology that placed men above women in spiritual hierarchy and worldly power. This legacy continues to influence contemporary culture and spiritual consciousness.

In Catholic doctrine and practice, leadership has been almost exclusively male. The priesthood is reserved for men – a rule rooted in the Church's interpretation of scripture and the all-male circle of Jesus's apostles. For centuries, it was taken as divine mandate that women could not represent Christ at the altar. This established a paradigm where the voice of God was mediated only through a male lens. Consequently, women were barred from positions of real decision-making (no female bishops, cardinals, popes), and their contributions were often relegated to "supportive" roles – teaching, nursing, charitable works – but not the authoritative teaching of doctrine or governance of the institution. The symbolism of this cannot be overstated: if half of humanity is deemed unfit to officially speak for or to God, that sends a powerful message about women's spiritual worth. It buttressed a broader societal notion that men are natural leaders and gatekeepers of truth, while women are followers or helpers.

Over time, this stance had cascading effects. In medieval Europe, for example, the Church's attitudes contributed to social views that women were more susceptible to sin (Eve's legacy) and needed male guidance to remain virtuous. Female mystics or leaders who stepped outside the accepted bounds were often viewed with suspicion or labeled heretical. The witch hunts of early modern Europe – which saw between 40,000 and 60,000 executions, roughly 75-80% of them women gendercide.org – were partly fueled by a fear of women who practiced alternative spirituality or healing. Such women were often condemned as consorting with evil, when in many cases they were carriers of pre-Christian folk knowledge or simply independent-minded. While the Church eventually distanced itself from witch trials, the cultural groundwork of mistrusting female spiritual power had been laid.

The Church also actively rewrote or obscured stories to diminish the feminine. A poignant example is Mary Magdalene – a close disciple of Jesus who many scholars believe had a prominent role in early Christianity. Yet for most of Church history, she was officially portrayed as a repentant prostitute rather than an apostolic leader. Only recently has the Vatican corrected this depiction, acknowledging there is no biblical basis for labeling her a sex worker. That initial recasting (often called a "soul-level psy-op" by feminist theologians) served to discredit the idea of a sacred feminine equal to the sacred masculine. Instead of a spiritual partnership between Jesus and Magdalene (as some Gnostic texts suggest), the narrative became one of a holy man redeeming a fallen woman – reinforcing the idea of women's spirituality being derived from or dependent on male holiness. Other traces of feminine divinity, such as reverence for Mother Mary, were kept but framed carefully: Mary is exalted, but always in submissive roles (the perpetual virgin mother), not as an autonomous divine presence.

In terms of power structures, the Catholic Church historically intertwined with state authority to enforce patriarchy. Marital and family laws for centuries (influenced by Church doctrine) cemented the husband/father as head of household with legal dominion over wife and children. These attitudes traveled through colonialism as well – missionary activities often went hand in hand with imposing Western gender norms on indigenous populations, undermining societies where women had held significant power (e.g., many African and Native American tribes with matrilineal systems). In essence, religious patriarchy became a global export.

It is important to credit that the Church, like any institution, is not monolithic or unchanging. There have been recent developments indicating a shift towards greater inclusion of women. Pope Francis himself acknowledged the "history of male domination" in the Church and has called for deeper female involvement in decision-making. In the Vatican, women have been appointed to high-ranking administrative roles for the first time in history. Discussions are ongoing (such as the current Synod on Synodality) about expanding women's roles, potentially even considering the diaconate for women. These changes show an awareness that the previous imbalance is neither spiritually nor morally tenable. However, resistance is strong, and many women inside and outside the Church feel these measures are only baby steps.

From a metaphysical law perspective, the historic exclusion of women from sacred offices violated the Law of Right Relationship, disrupting the intended balance and mutual respect in spiritual communities. If one conceives of a spiritual community as a body, amputating the feminine voice is akin to hobbling that body's ability to function harmoniously. It also goes against the Law of Soul Evolution: denying individuals opportunities based solely on gender inhibits their spiritual growth and contributions, thereby slowing the collective evolution of the faith. A community that does not allow all its members to exercise their spiritual gifts (whether preaching, leadership, or sacramental service) is operating below its potential enlightenment. Additionally, the Church's model inadvertently distorted the Law of Unity/Oneness by enshrining a hierarchy that placed women as spiritually "second-class." It fostered a dualism where masculine and feminine were not seen as two halves of a divine whole, but rather as superior vs. inferior – a philosophical error that rippled into broader culture.

The interplay of religion and gender distortion also connects with other systems: It provided theological justification for women's lesser status in law (government), limited women's access to education (education system), and even shaped language (for centuries, God was only referred to as "He," and mankind was the default term, invisibilizing women). This shows how a paradigm that started in ecclesiastical halls permeated everyday life.

Correcting this requires both internal reform in religious institutions and a reclamation of the sacred feminine across society. Many women (and men) today are seeking spiritual experiences outside patriarchal structures – reviving Goddess traditions, exploring mystic paths, or simply insisting on equality in their religious communities. Interestingly, mystic and esoteric branches of Christianity (like the Gnostics or certain contemplative orders) always held more egalitarian views, suggesting the imbalance was never an absolute divine mandate but rather a human imposition. As we integrate those lost pieces – recognizing divinity in the mother, the sister, the daughter, and the feminine aspect in each soul – we move toward a more complete spirituality that can heal some of the deepest wounds of our civilization.
