# The Destruction & Co-option of Indigenous Wisdom Systems -- Erasing 500+ Years of Accumulated Knowledge

## Content

The systematic destruction of indigenous wisdom systems represents one of the longest-running and most deliberate campaigns of knowledge erasure in human history. In the United States, over 350 government-funded boarding schools operated between 1869 and the 1960s under the explicit mandate to "Kill the Indian, save the man," forcibly removing Native American children from their families and punishing them for speaking their languages, practicing their ceremonies, or maintaining any connection to their cultural identity. In Canada, the last residential school did not close until 1996. In Australia, the Stolen Generations policy continued through the 1970s. Mass graves are still being discovered at former school sites. These were not educational institutions. They were engines of cultural genocide designed to sever the transmission of knowledge systems that had been refined over millennia, knowledge about ecological relationships, medicinal plants, astronomical cycles, governance structures, and spiritual practices that represented humanity's longest-running experiments in sustainable civilization.

What was not destroyed outright has been subjected to a second wave of assault through appropriation and commodification. Ayahuasca tourism packages indigenous ceremony as a consumer experience, stripping sacred practices from the cultural, relational, and ethical frameworks that give them meaning and safety. The patenting of traditional knowledge through biopiracy transforms communal wisdom into corporate property: the neem tree, turmeric, and even ayahuasca itself have been subjects of patent claims by Western corporations seeking to profit from knowledge developed by indigenous communities over centuries. Crystal shops, sage bundles, and smudging kits are sold as lifestyle accessories, the spiritual technologies of colonized peoples repackaged for the consumption of the colonizers' descendants without acknowledgment, compensation, or understanding. The New Age movement, while sometimes well-intentioned, has become a primary vehicle for this commodification, extracting practices from their living contexts and presenting them as universal spiritual tools available to anyone with a credit card.

The loss is incalculable and ongoing. When oral traditions are broken, the knowledge they carry does not merely fade. It ceases to exist, because oral knowledge systems are living processes that depend on continuous transmission through relationship, ceremony, and place. An estimated 500 or more years of accumulated ecological knowledge, refined through direct observation and reciprocal relationship with specific landscapes, has been destroyed or driven underground. Land back movements represent a growing resistance to this erasure, asserting not merely the return of stolen territory but the restoration of the relationship between people, knowledge, and place that colonialism sought to permanently sever. The destruction of indigenous wisdom is not a historical event. It is a continuing process, and its consequences extend far beyond indigenous communities to a global civilization that has severed itself from the very knowledge systems that might teach it how to live within the limits of a finite planet.

- Suppression of Sacred Science (Section 49) -- indigenous wisdom systems as a primary category of suppressed sacred knowledge
- Sacred Feminine Technologies (Section 47) -- matrilineal governance, feminine ceremonial knowledge, and earth-based spiritual practices destroyed through colonization
- Ecocide (Section 32) -- loss of indigenous ecological knowledge accelerating environmental destruction
- Religion (Section 48) -- missionary activity as a tool of cultural erasure; forced conversion
- Education (Section 14) -- residential schools as instruments of cultural genocide; ongoing Eurocentric curricula erasing indigenous contributions
