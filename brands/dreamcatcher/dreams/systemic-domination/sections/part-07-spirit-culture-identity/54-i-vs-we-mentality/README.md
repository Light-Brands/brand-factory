## Content

American culture heavily emphasizes individualism – the "I" over the "We." From a young age, Americans are taught to value personal freedom, self-reliance, and individual achievement. This mindset has benefits in fostering innovation and personal responsibility, but taken to extremes it erodes the sense of community and collective well-being. Observers have noted that something has shifted in recent times: "In America today, far too many of us are disconnected from each other, lonely, self-protective, or at each other's throats. Sacrifice for the common good feels anachronistic. Everything not nailed down has been commoditized or turned into a source of personal enrichment."time.com This poignant description highlights how hyper-individualism has led to social fragmentation. People increasingly feel isolated and suspicious, rather than supported by a strong communal fabric.

This "I over We" mentality is actively reinforced by systems that benefit from a divided populace. Culturally, the narrative of the rugged individual ("pick yourself up by your bootstraps") is celebrated, while collective action or social support is sometimes disparaged as "weak" or "socialist." The result is stark: "As privileged communities in America continue to advance, class division increases and the collective consciousness is further disrupted. The narrative of the strong, independent individual has been driven into the backbone of American society."berkeleybeacon.com Such a mindset can blind people to systemic problems – if someone is poor or sick, the culture often blames their personal choices rather than looking at broader causes. This undermines solidarity: when each person is taught to mainly look out for themselves, it becomes harder to organize and demand changes that benefit everyone (like universal healthcare or workers' rights). In effect, extreme individualism supports the distortion by preventing unified challenges to the status quo. A society of atomized individuals is less likely to mobilize against corporate or government abuses, because people are conditioned to think in terms of "I got mine" or to mistrust collective solutions. Meanwhile, those in power find it easier to maintain control, even as public welfare suffers. The antidote would be a rebalance – reviving the "We" consciousness, where community welfare and cooperation are valued alongside individual liberty. Only by remembering that we rise or fall together can the grip of this divisive mentality be loosened.
