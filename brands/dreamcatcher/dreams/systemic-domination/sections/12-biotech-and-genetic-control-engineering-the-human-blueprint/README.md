## Content

Protesters around the world have challenged the power of biotech giants that dominate the seed supply, underscoring public fears about corporate genetic control. Biotechnological engineering has opened backdoors to directly manipulate the code of life – from laboratory-designed crops to the prospect of “designer babies.” In the early 20th century, the eugenics movement exemplified how genetic science could be twisted into a doctrine of control. Eugenics claimed humanity could be “improved” through selective breeding, a notion that led to coercive policies targeting society’s most vulnerable. By replacing natural selection with artificial selection “determined by man,” eugenics inflicted great harm on marginalized groups in a misguided pursuit of perfection. Though repudiated in name, this ideology resurfaces today in debates over gene-editing and reproductive technology. Scientists warn that even well-intended uses of CRISPR on human embryos “could start us down a path towards non-therapeutic genetic enhancement” – a slippery slope toward neo-eugenics. In essence, biotech’s power to rewrite genes is also a power to define and control the trajectory of human evolution, usurping the natural order in violation of the sacred Law of Harmony and free will.

Modern genetic control extends beyond humans into the very food chain that sustains us. Transnational agritech corporations use genetic modification and patents to dominate agriculture, consolidating unprecedented control over farmers and food supplies. Over 53% of the world’s commercial seed market is now held by just three firms. Through aggressive litigation and restrictive patents, companies like Monsanto have “concerted efforts…to dominate the seed industry…and prevent farmers from replanting crops” harvested from patented GMO seeds. This means a handful of private entities effectively command what is grown and who eats, wielding genetic technology as a lever of global influence. Such domination of the seed stock not only undermines farmers’ autonomy but also dismantles biodiversity, as locally adapted heirloom strains give way to proprietary hybrids. Critics note that tampering with genomes on a large scale “causes significant loss to biodiversity and dismantle[s] the sensitive balance of [the] food chain”. By disrupting ecosystems and natural evolution, these practices flagrantly defy the Sacred Law of Balance in nature. The resulting monocultures and genetic uniformity heighten the risk of crop failures and ecological collapse – a reminder that attempts to impose control over nature often backfire.

Independent Conditioning: The biotech domain conditions human perception by normalizing the idea that life is technical and patentable. It frames human and animal genomes as assets to be edited or owned, subtly encouraging a view of living beings as products subject to top-down design. From gene-edited livestock to bespoke babies, society is invited to envision a future where our very biology bows to corporate or state plans. This paradigm erodes traditional notions of the sanctity of natural life and personal sovereignty over one’s body. It violates sacred principles – the Law of Life’s Wisdom (that nature’s design carries inherent intelligence) and the Law of Free Will (that sentient beings should evolve in self-determined ways). In practical terms, biotech control can manifest as forms of domination: populations might be engineered for docility or high productivity, and citizens may face pressure to accept mandated genetic or pharmaceutical interventions. Each step taken in this direction reinforces the architecture of systemic suppression: a populace that believes its health, food, and genetic future depend on biotech oligarchs is less likely to resist other forms of control.

Interlocking with Other Sectors: Biotech and genetic control interweave tightly with other components of the domination matrix. For instance, a society ingesting genetically altered foods or compulsory biomedical treatments could be more vulnerable to Mass Psychological Warfare (Section 14) – consider how mood-altering drugs or neurochemical additives might dull critical thinking. Digital surveillance regimes (Section 12) can merge with biotech via implanted microchips or DNA databases, monitoring individuals literally from inside. Moreover, decisions about whose genes to edit or which traits to favor are often made by entrenched Power Structures (Section 16), raising the specter of engineered social hierarchies tied to bloodlines or class. Indeed, echoes of eugenic philosophy persist in elite circles: the intent “to create superior humans is neither new, nor a product of modernity” – it has always been about preserving power. By controlling genetic destiny and the food supply, those at the top reinforce their dominion across all dimensions of life. In sum, biotech serves as both an independent tool of conditioning – making people dependent on technocrats for survival – and a glue that binds to other oppressive systems, ensuring that any challenge to the status quo can quite literally be engineered out.
