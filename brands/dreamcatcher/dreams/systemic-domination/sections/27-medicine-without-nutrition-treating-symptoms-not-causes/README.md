# Medicine Without Nutrition – Treating Symptoms, Not Causes

## Content

A telling indicator of the health system’s skewed priorities is that nutrition – arguably the foundation of health – is almost entirely excluded from medical training. Most physicians practicing today received “almost no nutritional training” in school; across four years of medical education, the average student got fewer than 20 hours on nutritionmed.stanford.edu. It’s an astonishing gap, given that diet is a major factor in chronic diseases (heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc.). Yet doctors are not typically taught how to counsel patients on healthy eating or preventive lifestyle changes. Instead, the focus is on diagnosing illnesses and prescribing drugs or performing procedures to manage them. This educational blind spot was not accidental. In the early 20th century, when modern medical curricula were being set, influential sponsors (with ties to pharmaceutical and processed food industries) favored a model of care centered on interventions (pills, surgeries) over prevention. As a result, generations of doctors have graduated adept at treating acute symptoms but with little knowledge or confidence to address underlying causes like poor nutrition, stress, or environmental toxins.

The consequence is a medical paradigm that often perpetuates problems instead of curing them. Patients commonly receive medications to control blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, mood, etc., and while these drugs can be lifesaving, they typically manage conditions rather than resolve them. A British cardiologist pointed out that “Most patients will derive no health improvement from medication. We should tackle the root causes of disease instead.”theguardian.com This is a damning insight – it implies that for many chronic issues, our pill-popping approach yields minimal benefit because it fails to remove the cause (unhealthy lifestyle, poor diet, etc.). For example, giving someone acid reflux medicine indefinitely is less ideal than helping them change their diet that’s causing the reflux; or prescribing insulin for Type 2 diabetes without addressing diet/exercise means the underlying metabolic problem remains. But under the current system, there is often little incentive to prioritize nutrition or prevention. Doctors operate in a rushed insurance-driven environment where writing a prescription or scheduling a procedure is reimbursed, but spending time coaching a patient on meal planning or exercise is not. Hospitals and pharmaceutical companies also profit more from ongoing treatments than from one-time cures or prevention. Indeed, cynically, there’s a saying: “A patient cured is a customer lost.” While that may be an extreme view, it reflects the structural bias of a healthcare industry that makes money when people stay sick (or just managed) but not when they are truly healthy.

Another stark example is in cancer care. Mainstream oncology tends to rely on “nuke it or cut it out” approaches (radiation, chemotherapy, surgery) – aggressive treatments that can be very effective at killing tumors, but also ravage the body and ignore why cancer may have taken hold. Alternative and integrative therapies, such as nutritional protocols, mind-body techniques, or non-toxic remedies, are often dismissed by oncologists because they fall outside conventional training or threaten the business model of chemo drugs and hospital procedures. And yet, many patients find that addressing diet, strengthening the immune system, and holistic methods greatly improve outcomes and quality of life. The distortion here is a medical culture focused on disease management rather than true health creation. By excluding nutrition and holistic healing from the doctor’s toolkit, the system ensures a steady flow of patients who rely on medications and operations – essentially treating the human body like a machine with parts to repair or remove, rather than an organism that can often heal itself if given proper support. This is slowly changing (there’s growing interest in lifestyle medicine and physicians who do emphasize nutrition), but the fact remains: for over a century, Western medicine’s education and practice have sidelined the very knowledge that could prevent so much illness. It’s a paradigm that keeps people coming back with recurring ailments – feeding the medical-industrial complex – instead of empowering them to avoid illness in the first place.
