# How They Connect

_Part of the [Systemic Domination](../../README.md) thesis._

## The Premise

This is where the dream gets real — mapping the interplay between these systems. How they reinforce each other. How political capture enables economic extraction, which funds media control, which shapes culture, which prevents collective action, which preserves political capture. The loop.

## The Reinforcing Loop

The core insight of this thesis is that these aren't ten separate problems. They're one machine with ten moving parts. Each system feeds the others, and the whole is designed — whether by intent or emergent behavior — to resist change.

### The Primary Loop

1. **Political Capture** protects corporate interests through legislation and deregulation
2. **Corporate Sovereignty** uses that protection to maximize extraction
3. **Economic Extraction** concentrates wealth at the top
4. **That wealth funds** media consolidation, lobbying, and campaign contributions
5. **Media & Information Control** shapes public narrative to normalize the arrangement
6. **The Culture Machine** converts that narrative into identity — people defend the system that harms them
7. **Cultural compliance** prevents collective action, which **preserves Political Capture**
8. The loop repeats

### The Support Systems

- **Healthcare as a Profit Engine** — keeps people financially fragile and job-dependent
- **Education — Defunded by Design** — limits the ability to see the loop
- **Criminal Justice & Mass Incarceration** — warehouses those the system discards
- **Labor & the War on Workers** — suppresses the one force (organized labor) that could interrupt the loop
- **Technology & Surveillance** — provides the infrastructure to monitor, predict, and control

## Key Interconnections to Map

_Each of these is a specific link between two systems. Expand and document them._

- Political Capture <-> Corporate Sovereignty
- Economic Extraction <-> Labor & the War on Workers
- Media & Information Control <-> The Culture Machine
- Education <-> Criminal Justice (school-to-prison pipeline)
- Healthcare <-> Labor (employer-tied insurance as a chain)
- Technology <-> Media (algorithmic delivery of narrative)
- Technology <-> Criminal Justice (predictive policing, surveillance)
- Economic Extraction <-> Education (student debt)
- Corporate Sovereignty <-> Media (corporate-owned media)
- The Culture Machine <-> Labor ("hustle culture" as reframing)

## Visual Mapping

_This section is for diagrams, charts, or visual representations of the interconnections. Consider:_

- A network diagram showing all system-to-system links
- A circular flow showing the primary reinforcing loop
- Weight/strength ratings for each connection
- Entry points where the loop is most vulnerable

---

## Open Questions

- Is there a single keystone system whose disruption would cascade?
- Are there connections we're missing?
- Where are the feedback loops strongest?
- Where are they weakest — and is that where change enters?
