# Transportation & Urban Planning as Control -- Building the Cage into the Landscape

_Part of the [Systemic Domination](../../../README.md) thesis._

## Content

Control does not always arrive as policy, propaganda, or chemical manipulation. Sometimes it is poured in concrete. The physical infrastructure of cities and suburbs in the United States was deliberately designed to produce car dependency, community isolation, and fossil fuel lock-in -- and the history is not speculative but documented and, in one notable case, criminally adjudicated. The General Motors streetcar conspiracy -- in which GM, Standard Oil, Firestone Tire, and other corporations formed National City Lines to systematically purchase and dismantle electric streetcar systems in cities across America -- resulted in criminal convictions in 1949. The streetcars were replaced with GM buses, which were in turn replaced by private automobiles as the only viable transportation in sprawling, car-dependent landscapes. Robert Moses, New York's master builder, routed highways directly through thriving Black neighborhoods -- the Cross Bronx Expressway alone displaced 60,000 residents -- while simultaneously designing overpasses on Long Island parkways too low for public buses, physically preventing lower-income New Yorkers from reaching public beaches.

Suburban sprawl, the dominant American development pattern from the 1950s onward, was not organic growth but engineered isolation: single-use zoning separated homes from workplaces, schools, and commercial districts, making a car mandatory for every daily activity. The average American now spends 54 minutes per day commuting -- time extracted from family, community, rest, and personal development. Oil dependency was locked into the national infrastructure, ensuring that fossil fuel interests would remain politically untouchable for generations. Public transit was systematically defunded, while the auto industry lobbied relentlessly against rail investment. Even the legal framework was shaped by industry: "jaywalking" -- a term invented by the automobile industry in the 1920s -- criminalized the act of walking in public space, redefining streets as belonging to cars rather than people. The health consequences extend beyond air pollution and accident fatalities: car-dependent planning produces food deserts (neighborhoods without grocery stores, reachable only by car), eliminates incidental physical activity (walking, cycling as daily transportation), and generates the social isolation that underpins epidemic loneliness. The contrast with European, Japanese, and pre-automobile American urban design -- walkable, mixed-use, transit-connected -- demonstrates that car dependency is not inevitable but chosen, and chosen for reasons that had nothing to do with human flourishing.

**Key mechanisms of control:**

- **Streetcar conspiracy.** General Motors streetcar conspiracy (National City Lines -- criminally convicted 1949)
- **Racist highway routing.** Robert Moses routing highways through Black neighborhoods
- **Suburban sprawl.** Engineered community isolation through single-use zoning
- **Car dependency.** Locking in fossil fuel economy through infrastructure design
- **Commuting as time theft.** 54 minutes/day average extracted from workers
- **Transit defunding.** Public transit defunding and anti-rail lobbying
- **Criminalization of walking.** "Jaywalking" laws invented by auto industry in the 1920s to criminalize pedestrians
- **Food deserts.** Created by car-dependent planning
- **Elimination of walkability.** Removing incidental physical activity from daily life
- **Single-use zoning.** Separating all functions of daily life
