# Part 5: Earth, Resources & Infrastructure

_Part of the [Systemic Domination](../../README.md) thesis._

## Theme

**"They've captured the commons itself."**

Beyond the individual body, mind, and wallet — the architecture extends to the planet. Water is privatized. Energy is monopolized. The earth is treated as an extraction site. Cities are built to enforce car dependency and isolation. Even time itself has been severed from natural rhythms and sold back as productivity. And the technological capacity to solve all of it exists — but is withheld. This part maps the capture of the shared inheritance: the commons.

## Reader Journey

The reader lifts their gaze from personal extraction to planetary extraction. Ecocide devastates the earth while inducing collective grief. Water — life itself — is privatized for profit. Energy is monopolized while alternatives are suppressed. Cities are designed to enforce isolation and fossil fuel dependency. Time is severed from lunar and seasonal rhythms and compressed into productivity metrics. And despite the capacity to solve every one of these problems, the system chooses not to. By the end of Part 5, the reader understands: *The commons — water, air, land, time, energy — have been enclosed. What belongs to everyone has been captured by the few.*
