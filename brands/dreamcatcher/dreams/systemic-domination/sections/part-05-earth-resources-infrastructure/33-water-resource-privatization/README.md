# Water & Natural Resource Privatization -- Enclosing the Commons

## Content

Water is life. The system is enclosing it.

Nestle (now BlueTriton) extracted millions of gallons of water from Michigan -- during the Flint water crisis -- paying $200 per year in permits while Flint residents paid some of the highest water rates in the country for water contaminated with lead. In 2000, the Bolivian city of Cochabamba erupted in revolt when the government privatized its water system and a Bechtel subsidiary raised rates by as much as 300%. The Cochabamba Water War became a landmark of anti-privatization resistance.

**Key mechanisms of control:**

- **Privatization of the commons.** Water, air, land, minerals, the electromagnetic spectrum, seeds, genetic sequences -- everything that was once shared is being enclosed. The English Enclosure Acts (1604-1914) dispossessed peasants of common land, forcing them into factory labor. The same logic operates today when water systems are privatized, public land is sold to extractors, and the radio spectrum is auctioned to telecoms.
- **Water crises as control.** Flint, Michigan went 1,800+ days with contaminated water. Jackson, Mississippi lost water pressure entirely in 2022. These are not natural disasters -- they are infrastructure decisions made by governments that deprioritize poor and Black communities.
- **Mineral rights and fracking.** In many US states, mineral rights are severed from surface rights, meaning a company can drill under your home without your consent. Fracking has contaminated groundwater in communities across Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Texas. Residents can light their tap water on fire.
- **Seed patenting.** Monsanto (now Bayer) has sued hundreds of farmers for "patent infringement" when patented seeds blew onto their land. Three companies control 53%+ of the global commercial seed market. The ability to grow food is being enclosed.
- **Ocean and air privatization.** Fishing rights are increasingly privatized through "catch share" systems. Carbon credit markets turn the atmosphere into a tradeable commodity. Even the orbit of Earth is being privatized through satellite constellations (Starlink occupying orbital space).

## Connections

_How does this system feed into or depend on the others?_

- Ecocide (Section 32) -- environmental destruction as extraction
- Food Supply (Section 08) -- seed patents, water for agriculture
- Biotech & Genetic Control (Section 10) -- genetic patenting
- Financial System & Capitalism (Section 23) -- commodification of natural resources
- Colonialism & Neo-Colonialism (Section 43) -- resource extraction from Global South
- Modern Government (Section 38) -- permitting, deregulation
