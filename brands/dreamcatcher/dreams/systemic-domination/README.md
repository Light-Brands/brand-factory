# Systemic Domination

A dream about seeing clearly — naming the machinery of control operating
across American life, not as conspiracy, but as observable, interlocking systems
that concentrate power and erode self-determination for ordinary people.

## The Through-Line

> What does it look like when every major system in a society slowly bends
> toward serving the same small set of interests — and most people inside
> it can't see the shape of the whole thing?

This dream maps the architecture. Not to despair. To see.

## The Systems

Each system has its own space for independent research, evidence gathering, and expansion. Click into any section to go deep.

| # | System | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 01 | [Political Capture](sections/01-political-capture/) | How governance serves donors over constituents |
| 02 | [Economic Extraction](sections/02-economic-extraction/) | How wealth flows upward by design |
| 03 | [Media & Information Control](sections/03-media-information-control/) | How narratives are shaped before opinions form |
| 04 | [Healthcare as a Profit Engine](sections/04-healthcare-profit-engine/) | The commodification of being alive |
| 05 | [Education — Defunded by Design](sections/05-education-defunded-by-design/) | The deliberate erosion of public knowledge |
| 06 | [Criminal Justice & Mass Incarceration](sections/06-criminal-justice-mass-incarceration/) | Warehousing people for profit |
| 07 | [Corporate Sovereignty](sections/07-corporate-sovereignty/) | When corporations outrank governments |
| 08 | [Labor & the War on Workers](sections/08-labor-war-on-workers/) | The campaign to destroy collective power |
| 09 | [Technology & Surveillance](sections/09-technology-surveillance/) | Convenience traded for autonomy |
| 10 | [The Culture Machine](sections/10-the-culture-machine/) | Manufacturing compliance from the inside out |

## The Architecture

These sections map the higher-order structure — how the systems interlock, where they break, and the raw material feeding the thesis.

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [How They Connect](sections/11-how-they-connect/) | The reinforcing loop — how every system feeds the others |
| [What Breaks the Loop](sections/12-what-breaks-the-loop/) | Resistance, pressure points, and earned hope |
| [Seeds](sections/13-seeds/) | Raw thoughts, links, data, quotes — the compost pile |

    Support Systems:
    ├── Healthcare ─── keeps people financially fragile
    ├── Education ──── limits ability to see the loop
    ├── Criminal Justice ── warehouses the discarded
    ├── Labor ───────── suppresses organized resistance
    └── Technology ──── monitors and controls

## How to Use This

- **Go deep on any system** — each section is self-contained and ready for independent expansion
- **Add evidence** — every section has space for data, sources, and examples
- **Map connections** — the "Connections" section in each system links it to the others
- **Drop seeds** — raw thoughts and fragments go in [Seeds](sections/13-seeds/) until they find a home
- **See the whole** — come back here to see how everything fits together
