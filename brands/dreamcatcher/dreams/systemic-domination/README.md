# Systemic Domination

## The Architecture of Spiritual Distortion

A dream about seeing clearly — naming the machinery of control operating across human civilization, not as conspiracy, but as observable, interlocking systems that shape beliefs, behaviors, and spiritual perceptions. This architecture spans nearly every sector of society — from healthcare and food to media, finance, religion, technology, language, governance, and the sacred itself.

## The Through-Line

> What does it look like when every major system in a society slowly bends
> toward serving the same small set of interests — and most people inside
> it can't see the shape of the whole thing?

This dream maps the architecture. Not to despair. To see.

## The 8-Part Structure

The thesis is organized as a narrative arc — a journey from seeing the architecture, through the domains it captures, to the power that maintains it, and finally to the paths of liberation.

| Part | Theme | Reader Journey |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **1. Foundations** | Framework & context | "Here's how to see the architecture" |
| **2. Body & Health** | What they do to our bodies | "They've captured your biology" |
| **3. Mind & Perception** | What they do to our minds | "They've captured your attention and thought" |
| **4. Economy & Labor** | How they extract wealth and labor | "They've captured your time and resources" |
| **5. Earth & Resources** | What they do to the planet | "They've captured the commons itself" |
| **6. Power & Governance** | How they maintain force and control | "This is who holds the levers" |
| **7. Spirit & Culture** | How they suppress the sacred and divide us | "They've tried to capture your soul" |
| **8. Liberation** | How we break free | "Here's how we reclaim it all" |

## The Compost Pile

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [Seeds](sections/99-seeds/) | Raw thoughts, links, data, quotes — drop them here as they come |

---

## How to Use This

- **Follow the narrative** — read Parts 1-8 in sequence for the full journey from seeing to liberation
- **Go deep on any system** — each of the 60 sections is self-contained with full thesis content
- **Add evidence** — every section has space for data, sources, and examples
- **Map connections** — the "Connections" section in each system links it to the others
- **Drop seeds** — raw thoughts and fragments go in [Seeds](sections/99-seeds/) until they find a home
- **See the whole** — come back here to see how everything fits together
