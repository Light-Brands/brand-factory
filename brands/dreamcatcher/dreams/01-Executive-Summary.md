# Sovereign Consulting Intelligence Platform

## Executive Summary & Opportunity Overview

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Classification:** Internal Strategic Planning

-----

## Vision Statement

Build a fully sovereign, multi-model consulting intelligence platform that aggregates the best capabilities from leading AI models, wrapped in proprietary methodology and values, with a clear path to complete independence through training a custom model on accumulated institutional knowledge.

-----

## Strategic Objectives

**Phase 1 - Aggregator (Months 1-12)**

- Build orchestration layer that routes queries to optimal models
- Capture all high-quality outputs to build proprietary knowledge core
- Serve clients profitably while building infrastructure
- Zero dependency on any single AI provider

**Phase 2 - Hybrid (Months 12-24)**

- Train proprietary model on accumulated data
- Shift traffic progressively to owned model
- Maintain external models for verification and gap-filling

**Phase 3 - Sovereign (Months 24-48)**

- Primary inference on fully-owned model
- External models optional for edge cases
- Complete independence achievable

## Investment Summary

|Phase              |Duration |Infrastructure Investment|Operational Costs (Monthly)|
|-------------------|---------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
|Phase 1: Aggregator|12 months|$150K - $350K            |$15K - $60K                |
|Phase 2: Hybrid    |12 months|$500K - $2M (training)   |$30K - $100K               |
|Phase 3: Sovereign |24 months|$2M - $8M (full cluster) |$50K - $150K               |

**Total 4-Year Infrastructure Investment:** $2.65M - $10.35M  
**Average Monthly Operations (at scale):** $50K - $150K

|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|Single provider dependency|Multi-model architecture from day one              |
|API cost volatility       |Path to owned inference                            |
|Data privacy concerns     |On-prem option, no external training on client data|
|Model capability gaps     |Ensemble approach, continuous evaluation           |
|Vendor lock-in            |Standard abstractions, hot-swap capability         |

## Recommendation

Proceed with Phase 1 implementation immediately. The aggregator architecture provides:

- Immediate revenue capability
- Low initial infrastructure investment
- Natural accumulation of training data
- Flexibility to accelerate or decelerate investment based on results
- No irreversible commitments

The system pays for itself through client work while building toward full sovereignty.
