# Systemic Domination

A dream about seeing clearly — naming the machinery of control operating
across American life, not as conspiracy, but as observable, interlocking systems
that concentrate power and erode self-determination for ordinary people.

## The Through-Line

> What does it look like when every major system in a society slowly bends
> toward serving the same small set of interests — and most people inside
> it can't see the shape of the whole thing?

This dream maps the architecture. Not to despair. To see.

## The Systems

### Political Capture

<!-- How elections, legislation, and governance have been restructured to serve donors and corporate interests over constituents. The revolving door. Lobbying as the real legislative process. Gerrymandering. Voter suppression as strategy. -->

---

### Economic Extraction

<!-- Wage stagnation vs. productivity. The financialization of everything. How wealth flows upward by design — not accident. Housing as speculation. Debt as control. The death of the middle class as a feature, not a bug. -->

---

### Media & Information Control

<!-- Consolidation of media ownership. Algorithmic manipulation. The manufacturing of consent and division simultaneously. News as entertainment. The destruction of local journalism. How narratives are shaped before people even begin to form opinions. -->

---

### Healthcare as a Profit Engine

<!-- The commodification of being alive. Insurance as gatekeeping. Pharmaceutical pricing. Medical debt as the leading cause of bankruptcy. A system designed to extract maximum revenue from human suffering. -->

---

### Education — Defunded by Design

<!-- The deliberate underfunding of public education. Student debt as an economic leash. The pipeline from school to workforce compliance. Critical thinking as a threat to the system. The privatization agenda. -->

---

### Criminal Justice & Mass Incarceration

<!-- Policing as revenue generation. Private prisons and their lobbying arms. The school-to-prison pipeline. Criminalization of poverty. A system that warehouses people rather than rehabilitates — because warehousing is profitable. -->

---

### Corporate Sovereignty

<!-- When corporations hold more power than governments. Regulatory capture. Tax avoidance at scale. Corporate personhood. The quiet rewriting of laws to serve capital over citizens. -->

---

### Labor & the War on Workers

<!-- Union busting. The gig economy as exploitation rebranded. At-will employment. The erosion of benefits, pensions, and stability. How "hustle culture" masks systemic failure. -->

---

### Technology & Surveillance

<!-- Data harvesting as the new oil. Surveillance capitalism. AI and algorithmic bias. The tech monopoly stranglehold. How convenience became the currency we traded for privacy and autonomy. -->

---

### The Culture Machine

<!-- Individualism as ideology. The American Dream as sedative. Meritocracy myth. How culture is manufactured to keep people blaming themselves instead of the systems. Distraction as governance. -->

---

## How They Connect

<!-- This is where the dream gets real — mapping the interplay between these systems. How they reinforce each other. How political capture enables economic extraction, which funds media control, which shapes culture, which prevents collective action, which preserves political capture. The loop. -->

---

## What Breaks the Loop

<!-- If this dream grows legs — what does resistance look like? What are people already doing? What would it take? This section is for hope that's earned, not performed. -->
