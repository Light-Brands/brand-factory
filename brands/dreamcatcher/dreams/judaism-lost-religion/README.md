# Judaism: The Lost Religion of the Future

A dream about rediscovering what Judaism actually is — not as the world has framed it, not as modern institutions have packaged it, but as a living system of law, ethics, community, and sacred relationship with the divine that may hold keys to what humanity is searching for next.

## The Through-Line

> What if the most ancient surviving spiritual tradition is also the most
> misunderstood — and what it actually teaches is closer to the future
> we need than anything currently on offer?

This dream explores that question. Not as apology or defense, but as excavation.

## The Thesis

Three interlocking claims:

1. **If you believe in Jesus, you believe in Judaism** — he was Jewish, taught Torah, practiced Jewish law, never left Judaism
2. **Judaism (through Kabbalah) is the active distribution of divine light** — the Zohar, the Sefirot, and Tikkun Olam are a technology for receiving and transmitting divine energy
3. **This is WHY Judaism has been persecuted** — darkness attacks the source of light. The 2,000-year pattern is not random; it is spiritual warfare
