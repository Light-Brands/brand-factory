# Frequency Wellness Platform: Build Our Own QiCoil

A dream about building a sovereign frequency wellness technology platform — combining PEMF hardware, a software frequency console, and a subscription-based frequency library. A deep competitive teardown of QiCoil (Qi Life) and a technical feasibility study for building our own version from scratch.

## The Core Question

QiCoil sells electromagnetic coils for $679-$1,079, proprietary frequency console software for $1,500-$13,000, and recurring frequency subscriptions. Their hardware costs ~$10 to build. Their software is a frequency generator running through a speaker/coil. What if we built a better version — open, beautiful, technically honest — and captured this market with superior product and brand?

## What This Dream Contains

A complete competitive intelligence study and build feasibility analysis for creating a frequency wellness hardware + software platform.

### Document Package

| # | Document | What It Covers |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 01 | [Competitive Teardown: QiCoil](./01-competitive-teardown.md) | What QiCoil is, how it works, their full product line, pricing, and business model |
| 02 | [Technical Architecture: How It Actually Works](./02-technical-architecture.md) | The real technology behind PEMF, frequency generation, coil design, and the software stack |
| 03 | [Build Feasibility & Cost Analysis](./03-build-feasibility.md) | What it would take to build our own — hardware, software, content, and go-to-market |

## The Opportunity

- **Market Size:** PEMF therapy device market is $557-$820M (2024), growing 4.5-7.3% CAGR to $1B+ by 2033
- **QiCoil Margins:** Hardware that costs $10-50 to build sells for $679-$13,000. Software is a frequency generator with a locked content library
- **Differentiation Gap:** The entire space is full of pseudoscience marketing. Nobody is building beautiful, honest, well-engineered frequency tools
- **Recurring Revenue:** Frequency library subscriptions create SaaS-like recurring revenue on top of hardware sales

## Why This Matters

Frequency therapy exists on a spectrum from established science (FDA-cleared PEMF for bone healing, pain) to fringe claims (quantum frequencies for manifestation). The honest middle ground — building beautiful tools that deliver real PEMF therapy without pseudoscience — is wide open. QiCoil proves the demand exists. We can serve it better.

## Status

Competitive teardown and technical feasibility complete. Three documents covering market analysis, technical architecture, and build planning. Ready for review and decision on whether to pursue.
