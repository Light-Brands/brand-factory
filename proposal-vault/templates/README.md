## Tips for Strong Proposals

### Be Specific
- Generic statements don't help the council evaluate your alignment
- Use concrete examples, numbers, and specifics

### Be Honest
- Acknowledge challenges and risks openly
- The council values transparency over perfection
- Shadow integration is a strength, not a weakness

### Be Complete
- Incomplete proposals return for additional information
- This delays your review—save time by completing everything upfront

### Be Authentic
- Write in your brand's voice
- Share your genuine story and vision
- The council reads for soul alignment, not polish

## The 8/10 Threshold

All proposals are evaluated across 10 alignment dimensions:

1. Soul Purpose Alignment
2. Gaia Harmony
3. Sacred Systems Integration
4. Cultural Restoration
5. Collective Futures
6. Exchange Stewardship
7. Multiverse Reflection
8. Indigenous Wisdom Honor
9. Shadow Integration
10. Governance Readiness

**Proposals scoring 8/10 or higher proceed to partnership contracts.**

Proposals below threshold receive detailed feedback and may iterate up to 3 times.
