### 5.1 Engagement Pricing

| Description | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| InvestOS Partner (Full Arsenal) — All 10 Categories | $575,000.00 |
| Reg A+ Compliance & Qualification Layer | $50,000.00 |
| **Total Investment** | **$625,000.00** |

### 5.2 Payment Options

Client may select one of the following payment structures. All deliverables are identical regardless of payment option selected.

---

#### Option 1: Standard (50/50 Split) — Recommended

| Milestone | Amount | Trigger |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Kickoff Deposit | $312,500 (50%) | Upon execution of this agreement |
| Final Delivery | $312,500 (50%) | Upon delivery of complete package |
| **Total** | **$625,000** | |

---

#### Option 2: Confidence Model (30/70 Split)

Deferred portion triggered by raise progress. Includes 8.75% premium on deferred amount.

| Milestone | Amount | Trigger |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Kickoff Deposit | $187,500 (30%) | Upon execution of this agreement |
| Deferred Payment | $475,781 (70% + premium) | Upon raise closing or 50% threshold |
| **Total** | **$663,281** | |

**Deferred Payment Terms:**
- Triggered when Endless reaches 50%+ of $75M target ($37.5M) from non-affiliated investors
- Payment due within 30 days of threshold trigger
- Maximum deferral period: 12 months from final deliverable (extendable to 18 months by mutual agreement)
- Quarterly check-ins required during deferral period

---

#### Option 3: Founder's Bet (Zero Down — Deferred Payment)

Full risk absorbed by Consultant. Zero upfront cost to Client. Consultant delivers the complete Full Arsenal engagement at no charge, with a discounted deferred fee and up to 12 months to pay after delivery. Payment is tied to delivery of the product — not to the outcome of the raise. This option reflects Consultant's confidence in the Endless team and commitment to a true partnership.

| Milestone | Amount | Trigger |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Kickoff Deposit | $0 | — |
| Deferred Fee | $750,000 | Due within 360 days of final delivery |
| **Total** | **$750,000** | |

**Pricing Basis:**

| | Amount |
|---|---|
| Founder's Bet Success Fee | $1,500,000.00 |
| Endless Partnership Discount (50%) | -$750,000.00 |
| **Success Fee After Discount** | **$750,000.00** |

*Client saves $750,000 off the standard Founder's Bet fee. Success fee collected only upon raise success.*

**Deferred Payment Terms:**

The payment clock begins on the date Consultant delivers the final deliverable package ("Delivery Date" / "Day 0"). Client has up to 360 days (12 months) from Delivery Date to pay the full $750,000. **This structure is designed so that Client can pay the entire fee with zero interest** — all it takes is hitting each quarterly milestone. The fee is tied to delivery of the product, not to the outcome of the capital raise.

**Quarterly Payment Schedule:**

| Window | Days After Delivery | 0% Interest If... | Payment to Stay at 0% | Cumulative Paid |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Q1 — Grace Period** | 0-90 | Automatic | No payment required | $0 |
| **Q2** | 91-180 | 50%+ paid by Day 90 | $375,000 | $375,000 |
| **Q3** | 181-270 | 75%+ paid by Day 180 | $187,500 | $562,500 |
| **Q4** | 271-360 | 87.5%+ paid by Day 270 | $93,750 | $656,250 |
| **Final** | Day 360 | — | $93,750 | $750,000 |

**How It Works:**

- **Days 1-90 (Q1 — Grace Period):** No payment required. No interest. Full 90-day grace period following delivery.

- **Day 91 — First Checkpoint:**
  - **50%+ paid ($375,000+)?** Remaining balance continues at 0% interest through Day 180.
  - **Less than 50% paid?** 10% annual interest begins accruing immediately on Day 91 on the unpaid balance only. Not retroactive — Days 1-90 remain interest-free. If Client catches up to the 75% threshold by Day 180, interest stops accruing going forward.

- **Day 181 — Second Checkpoint:**
  - **75%+ paid ($562,500+)?** Remaining balance continues at 0% interest through Day 270.
  - **Less than 75% paid?** 10% annual interest begins accruing immediately on Day 181 on the unpaid balance only.

- **Day 271 — Third Checkpoint:**
  - **87.5%+ paid ($656,250+)?** Remaining balance continues at 0% interest through Day 360.
  - **Less than 87.5% paid?** 10% annual interest begins accruing immediately on Day 271 on the unpaid balance only.

- **Day 360 — Final Payment Due:**
  Full remaining principal plus any accrued interest is due. No extensions beyond 360 days. 10% annual interest applies to any balance remaining after Day 360 until paid in full.

**The principle is simple: pay half of what's left at each 90-day checkpoint, and you pay zero interest. We built this to reward momentum, not penalize timing.**

**Interest Policy:**
- **Rate:** 10% per annum
- **Basis:** Unpaid balance only — never the full fee amount
- **Trigger:** Forward-looking only — interest begins the day a threshold is missed, never retroactively
- **Non-compounding:** Interest is simple interest, not compounded
- **Stoppable:** If Client catches up to the next checkpoint threshold, interest stops accruing from that day forward

**Additional Terms:**
- Deferred fee is a fixed dollar figure ($750,000), not a percentage of capital raised
- Payment obligation is tied to delivery of the product, not to the outcome of the capital raise
- Maximum payment period: 360 days (12 months) from Delivery Date — no extensions
- Quarterly check-ins between Client and Consultant are required during the payment period
- All deliverables are Client's upon delivery — Client retains all work product regardless of payment timeline
