### $75M Regulation A Infrastructure

---

**Proposal Number:** LB-2026-008
**Date:** February 11, 2026
**Valid Until:** March 13, 2026

---

## Parties

**Service Provider:**
Light Brands Consulting
(hereinafter referred to as "Consultant")

**Client:**
Endless
(hereinafter referred to as "Client")

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### This Is a Partnership Proposal

This is not a vendor pitch. Light Brands Consulting is proposing a **strategic partnership** with Endless — one that begins with building the complete infrastructure for a **$75,000,000 Regulation A (Reg A+) raise** and extends into long-term operational support as Endless scales post-raise.

We want to be in the trenches with you — not just before the raise, but after it. We believe in what Endless is building, and this proposal is structured to reflect that belief at every level: in the scope, in the pricing, and in the options we're putting on the table.

### What We Deliver

**InvestOS** is a vertical operating system purpose-built for organizations raising capital at institutional scale. It replaces the traditional piecemeal approach — which typically requires 8+ separate vendors, 6-12 months, and $3M-$7M+ in fees — with a single integrated engagement delivering all strategic, financial, legal, operational, and technology infrastructure within **30 days**.

This proposal encompasses all ten (10) InvestOS service categories, fully customized for a $75M Reg A offering structure. No modules excluded. 150+ documents. 550,000+ words. A 30-page custom investor platform. Everything Endless needs to be investor-ready in 30 days.

But the engagement doesn't stop at the raise. This proposal also includes our commitment to serve as an embedded partner post-raise — across advisory, development, marketing, legal, operations, project management, and AI-powered automation (Section 5).

### Three Ways In

We've structured three payment options because we understand that every founder's situation is different. The deliverables are identical across all three — what changes is the financial structure and the depth of partnership alignment.

| Option | Structure | Total | Upfront | What It Signals |
|--------|-----------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **Option 1: Standard** | 50/50 split | $625,000 | $312,500 | Clean, straightforward — let's get to work |
| **Option 2: Confidence Model** | 30/70 split | $663,281 | $187,500 | Lower barrier to entry, premium on deferred portion |
| **Option 3: Founder's Bet** | Zero down — equity + deferred cash | $1,000,000 | $0 | Full partnership alignment — we bet on each other |

**Option 3 (Founder's Bet)** is the deepest expression of this partnership. Zero upfront cost. $500K in deferred cash. $500K in equity. A $500K discount off the standard fee. And the opportunity for Endless to earn **5% equity in Light Brands Consulting / Studio** by being the first client to close a seven-figure deal with us — a milestone we'll actively partner to achieve together.

Every option gets the same arsenal. The Founder's Bet just means we're building it shoulder to shoulder.

### By the Numbers

| | |
|---|---|
| **Comparable Traditional Cost** | $3,350,000 - $7,700,000 |
| **Standard Investment (Options 1 & 2)** | $625,000 - $663,281 |
| **Founder's Bet Investment** | $1,000,000 ($0 upfront) |
| **Delivery Timeline** | 30 days |
| **Traditional Timeline** | 6-12 months |

## 5. Post-Raise Partnership — Ongoing Advisory & Implementation

### 5.1 Beyond the Raise

The raise is the starting line — what comes after is where the real value is built.

Regardless of which payment option Endless selects, this proposal includes Light Brands Consulting's commitment to serve as a long-term operational partner post-raise. We are exceptionally effective at building the infrastructure to raise capital. We are even more effective at implementing what comes next.

### 5.2 Areas of Support

Light Brands Consulting is prepared to serve as an embedded partner across every critical business function that Endless needs to scale post-raise, including but not limited to:

| Function | How We Help |
|----------|-------------|
| **Advisory** | Ongoing strategic counsel, board-level support, investor relations, and capital deployment strategy |
| **Development** | Product engineering, platform buildout, technical architecture, and AI-powered development at speed |
| **Marketing** | Brand strategy, growth marketing, investor communications, content systems, and audience acquisition |
| **Legal** | Contract infrastructure, compliance frameworks, entity management, and regulatory coordination |
| **Operations** | Process design, workflow automation, vendor management, and operational scaling |
| **Project Management** | Execution oversight, milestone tracking, cross-functional coordination, and delivery assurance |
| **AI Automation** | Intelligent automation of critical business processes — identifying what should be automated, building it, and scaling it so the team operates at 10x capacity without 10x headcount |

### 5.3 Implementation Approach

We don't believe in bloated retainers or advisory roles that produce slide decks. Our model is implementation-first:

1. **Identify** — Map every critical business process that touches the post-raise budget
2. **Prioritize** — Rank by impact, urgency, and automation potential
3. **Build** — Deploy AI-powered systems, workflows, and infrastructure that actually run the business
4. **Scale** — Continuously optimize so that what works at $5M works at $50M

### 5.4 Why This Matters

Most companies raise capital and then spend 12-18 months figuring out how to deploy it efficiently. By the time operations catch up to the capital, the window has narrowed. We collapse that timeline. The same team that built your raise infrastructure builds your operational infrastructure — no handoff, no ramp-up, no lost context.

### 5.5 Engagement Structure

Post-raise partnership terms will be scoped based on Endless's priorities, budget allocation, and timeline following the raise. This section establishes the intent and framework for a deeper, longer-term partnership — the conversation starts on Day 1, not after the money lands.

| **Total Investment** | **$625,000.00** |

### 6.2 Payment Options

Client may select one of the following payment structures. All deliverables are identical regardless of payment option selected.

---

#### Option 1: Standard (50/50 Split) — Recommended

| Milestone | Amount | Trigger |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Kickoff Deposit | $312,500 (50%) | Upon execution of this agreement |

| **Total** | **$663,281** | |

**Deferred Payment Terms:**
- Payment due within 30 days of final delivery
- Quarterly check-ins required during engagement

---

#### Option 3: Founder's Bet (Zero Down — Deferred Payment)

Zero upfront cost to Client. Consultant delivers the complete Full Arsenal engagement at a discounted rate, split evenly between deferred cash and equity. This option reflects Consultant's confidence in the Endless team and commitment to a true partnership.

| Component | Amount | Form |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Kickoff Deposit | $0 | — |
| Deferred Cash Fee | $500,000 | Cash — due within 360 days of final delivery |
| Equity Component | $500,000 | Equity in Endless — issued upon execution |
| **Total Engagement Value** | **$1,000,000** | |

**Pricing Basis:**

| | Amount |
|---|---|
| Founder's Bet Standard Fee | $1,500,000.00 |
| Endless Partnership Discount | -$500,000.00 |
| **Discounted Fee** | **$1,000,000.00** |
| Paid via Equity (50%) | $500,000.00 |
| Paid via Deferred Cash (50%) | $500,000.00 |

*Client saves $500,000 off the standard Founder's Bet fee. Remaining $1,000,000 split evenly between equity and deferred cash, aligning long-term interests between both parties.*

**Equity Terms:**
- Consultant shall receive $500,000 in equity in Endless, valued at the **pre-money valuation** with no discount applied
- Equity shall be issued upon execution of this agreement
- Specific equity instrument, share class, vesting schedule (if any), and governance rights to be defined in a separate Equity Issuance Agreement executed concurrently with this proposal
- Consultant's equity position shall carry standard anti-dilution protections and information rights

**Deferred Payment Terms:**

The payment clock begins on the date Consultant delivers the final deliverable package ("Delivery Date" / "Day 0"). Client has up to 360 days (12 months) from Delivery Date to pay the full $500,000 cash portion. **This structure is designed so that Client can pay the entire cash fee with zero interest** — all it takes is hitting each quarterly milestone.

**Quarterly Payment Schedule:**

| Window | Days After Delivery | 0% Interest If... | Payment to Stay at 0% | Cumulative Paid |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Q1 — Grace Period** | 0-90 | Automatic | No payment required | $0 |
| **Q2** | 91-180 | 50%+ paid by Day 90 | $250,000 | $250,000 |
| **Q3** | 181-270 | 75%+ paid by Day 180 | $125,000 | $375,000 |
| **Q4** | 271-360 | 87.5%+ paid by Day 270 | $62,500 | $437,500 |
| **Final** | Day 360 | — | $62,500 | $500,000 |

**How It Works:**

- **Days 1-90 (Q1 — Grace Period):** No payment required. No interest. Full 90-day grace period following delivery.

- **Day 91 — First Checkpoint:**
  - **50%+ paid ($250,000+)?** Remaining balance continues at 0% interest through Day 180.
  - **Less than 50% paid?** 10% annual interest begins accruing immediately on Day 91 on the unpaid balance only. Not retroactive — Days 1-90 remain interest-free. If Client catches up to the 75% threshold by Day 180, interest stops accruing going forward.

- **Day 181 — Second Checkpoint:**
  - **75%+ paid ($375,000+)?** Remaining balance continues at 0% interest through Day 270.
  - **Less than 75% paid?** 10% annual interest begins accruing immediately on Day 181 on the unpaid balance only.

- **Day 271 — Third Checkpoint:**
  - **87.5%+ paid ($437,500+)?** Remaining balance continues at 0% interest through Day 360.
  - **Less than 87.5% paid?** 10% annual interest begins accruing immediately on Day 271 on the unpaid balance only.

- **Day 360 — Final Payment Due:**
  Full remaining principal plus any accrued interest is due. No extensions beyond 360 days. 10% annual interest applies to any balance remaining after Day 360 until paid in full.

**The principle is simple: pay half of what's left at each 90-day checkpoint, and you pay zero interest. We built this to reward momentum, not penalize timing.**

**Interest Policy:**
- **Rate:** 10% per annum
- **Basis:** Unpaid balance only — never the full fee amount
- **Trigger:** Forward-looking only — interest begins the day a threshold is missed, never retroactively
- **Non-compounding:** Interest is simple interest, not compounded
- **Stoppable:** If Client catches up to the next checkpoint threshold, interest stops accruing from that day forward

**Additional Terms:**
- Deferred cash fee is a fixed dollar figure ($500,000) for professional services rendered
- Payment obligation begins upon delivery of the final deliverable package
- Maximum payment period: 360 days (12 months) from Delivery Date — no extensions
- Quarterly check-ins between Client and Consultant are required during the payment period
- All deliverables are Client's upon delivery — Client retains all work product regardless of payment timeline

**Partnership Incentive — 5% Equity in Light Brands Consulting / Studio:**

Endless has the opportunity to earn a **5% equity stake in Light Brands Consulting / Studio** by becoming the first client to execute a **seven-figure ($1,000,000+) engagement** with the firm.

This isn't a passive incentive — it's a mutual commitment. Consultant will actively partner with Client to pursue this at scale, leveraging Client's network, relationships, and client base to structure deals that dwarf the $1M threshold and set both parties up for outsized, long-term success.

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Incentive** | 5% equity in Light Brands Consulting / Studio |
| **Trigger** | Client is the first to execute a 7-figure ($1M+) deal with Consultant |
| **Consultant Commitment** | Active partnership with Client to identify, structure, and close opportunities across Client's network at a scale that makes the $1M milestone a starting point, not a ceiling |
| **Equity Instrument** | To be defined in a separate Equity Grant Agreement executed upon milestone achievement |
| **Spirit of the Deal** | Both parties go all-in together — Consultant brings the arsenal, Client brings the relationships, and together we build something neither could alone |

*This incentive reflects the true nature of the Founder's Bet: we're not just building infrastructure for Endless — we're building a partnership. Be first to the table at seven figures and own a piece of the engine that built it.*
