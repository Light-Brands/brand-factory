### 4. Section 18 - Indemnification

| Aspect | Our Request | v3 Implementation | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Damage Type | Limit to direct damages | "direct damages" added | ✅ COMPLETE |

> "Vendor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company from and against any direct damages, losses, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from third-party claims to the extent caused by Vendor's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement."

**Note:** They actually went further than requested by limiting indemnification to "third-party claims" - this is more favorable than what we asked for.

## @legal Consultation & Sign-Off

**Consultation Date:** January 23, 2026
**Reviewed By:** Legal Counsel

### Legal Opinion

**Matter:** Cho Ventures, LP - NDA v3 Final Review
**Question Presented:** Is the revised NDA (v3) acceptable for execution?

### Short Answer

**Yes.** The NDA v3 is now balanced, commercially reasonable, and appropriate for a strategic consulting engagement. All material concerns from v1 and v2 have been addressed. The agreement adequately protects Light Brands' core business interests.

### Analysis

**1. IP Protection (Critical Concern - RESOLVED)**

The Background IP carve-out in Section 10(e) is well-drafted and protects Light Brands' pre-existing methodologies, frameworks, and tools. The license grant for incorporated Background IP is appropriately limited (non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, solely as embodied in deliverables). This aligns with industry standard consulting terms.

**2. Non-Solicitation (High Concern - RESOLVED)**

The 12-month restricted period is reasonable and within market norms for consulting engagements. The narrowed scope (clients introduced by Cho or directly worked with; personnel directly collaborated with) prevents overreach while still protecting Cho's legitimate business interests. The "Material Contact" language has been replaced with clear, objective criteria.

**3. Corporate Opportunities (High Concern - RESOLVED)**

The revised language ("currently conducted business or business actively pursuing... specifically identified in writing") transforms this from a problematic catch-all into a reasonable, bounded obligation. The written identification requirement provides certainty and prevents disputes about scope.

**4. Indemnification (High Concern - RESOLVED)**

The revised indemnification is now appropriately limited:
- **Direct damages only** (excludes consequential, punitive)
- **Third-party claims only** (excludes direct claims by Cho)
- **Gross negligence or willful misconduct standard** (excludes ordinary negligence)

This is more favorable than typical consulting agreements and represents a significant concession from Cho.

**5. Remaining Terms (Acceptable)**

All other terms (Private Information definition, confidentiality obligations, non-disparagement, social media, remedies, governing law) are standard for this type of agreement and do not present material risk.

### Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Level | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Operational Impact | Low | 12-month non-solicit is manageable |
| IP Exposure | Low | Background IP fully protected |
| Financial Exposure | Low | Indemnification appropriately limited |
| Business Flexibility | Low | Corporate opportunity scope is bounded |
| **Overall Risk** | **LOW** | Agreement is commercially reasonable |

### Recommendation

**APPROVED FOR EXECUTION**

The negotiation process demonstrates that Cho Ventures is a collaborative partner willing to reach balanced terms. This bodes well for the business relationship. The final agreement protects Light Brands' interests while maintaining a reasonable framework for the engagement.

### Conditions

None. Agreement may be executed as-is.
