**Subject: Quick Questions on NDA - Cho Ventures Partnership**

Hi Darlene,

Thank you for sending over the NDA - excited to get things formalized so we can move forward together.

As I reviewed it, a few items caught my eye that I wanted to clarify to make sure we're aligned:

1. **Template fit** - I noticed references to patients, residents, and HIPAA compliance. Was this perhaps a template intended for a different vendor category? Happy to use a version more tailored to consulting engagements if one exists.

2. **Work product & IP** - Section 10 assigns all work product to FOC. Since our engagement involves applying our existing methodologies and frameworks, could we add standard language carving out pre-existing IP? This is pretty typical for consulting arrangements.

3. **Corporate opportunities** - Section 5 requires disclosure of opportunities relating to FOC's "reasonably contemplated business." Given the breadth of the Cho ecosystem, could you help me understand what this would look like in practice?

4. **Non-solicitation scope** - The 2-year client and vendor restrictions are quite broad. Is there flexibility here, or is this standard across all FOC vendor relationships?

I want to be respectful of your process while making sure we're all in alignment. Let me know if there is anything I can do on my end to support this.  

Looking forward to getting started.

Warmly,
Dan Lawless
