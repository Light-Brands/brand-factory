Hi Jason,

Great connecting with you. As promised, I wanted to follow up with the details on our bridge round.

The short version: We're raising $100K to give us comfortable runway while we execute on what we've built. We're not planning a traditional fundraise after this — we believe we have the team and the product to get to profitability without diluting further.

**The opportunity for you:**

You put in $100K now. In six months, you choose:

- **Option A:** Convert to 1% equity at a $10M valuation
- **Option B:** Take your money back with a 20% return ($120K cash)

Your call. Either way, you're protected.

**Why this is different:**

We're not building to raise — we're building to win. This is likely the only chance to get in before we're profitable and before valuations reflect what we're actually doing. Once we're cash-flow positive, we're not selling cheap.

I've attached the term sheet with the full details. Happy to walk through anything on a call.

Let me know if you're in.

## TALKING POINTS FOR CALL WITH JASON SPARKS

### Opening

> "We're doing a small bridge — $100K — to give us room to execute without pressure. We're not planning to raise again after this. We believe we've got the team and the path to profitability. This is about comfort, not survival."

### Explaining the Structure

> "Here's what I'm offering: you put in $100K. In six months, one of two things happens. Either you convert into 1% of the company at a $10M valuation. Or you take your money back with a 20% return — $120K cash. Your choice."

### Why It's a Good Deal for Jason

> "You get downside protection — worst case, you get paid back with a premium. But if we hit our numbers, and I believe we will, you're going to want that equity. This is probably the last time anyone gets in at this valuation."

### Why We're Confident

> "We have the team. We have the product. We're not building to flip or to keep raising — we're building a real business. The $100K just lets us do it without anyone taking a pay cut or stressing about runway."

### Handling Pushback on the $10M Valuation

> "I get that $10M might feel high for where we are today. But that's exactly why I'm giving you the repayment option. If we don't deliver, you get your money back plus 20%. If we do deliver, $10M is going to look like a steal."

### Closing

> "I'm not shopping this around. I wanted to give you first look because of our relationship. If the terms work for you, we can get docs done quickly and close this out."
