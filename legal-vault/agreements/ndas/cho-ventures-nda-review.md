# NDA Analysis: FOC Fund Manager QOZB, LLC (Cho Ventures)

**Review Date:** January 2026
**Document:** Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Disclosure Agreement
**Issuing Party:** FOC Fund Manager QOZB, LLC (part of Cho Ventures / Future of Cities)
**Intended Signatory:** Light Brands (as "Vendor")
**Governing Law:** Florida

---

## Executive Summary

This NDA contains several provisions that are significantly more restrictive than typical consulting agreements and directly conflict with Light Brands' standard engagement terms. **Recommendation: Do not sign as-is.**

---

## Key Concerns and Risk Assessment

### 1. Extremely Broad Definition of "Private Information" (Section 1)

**Risk Level: HIGH**

The definition is extraordinarily expansive and includes:
- Photographs
- Medical histories and conditions (HIPAA references)
- Personal financial information
- "Relationships and interpersonal dynamics"
- Passwords
- "Any information not generally known to the public"
- Pictures, recordings, images, writings relating to the Company or ANY invitee/vendor

**Concern:** This appears drafted for a healthcare/residential facility context, not a consulting engagement. The medical/HIPAA provisions are unusual for a business consulting relationship.

---

### 2. Prohibition on Capturing Any Media (Section 1)

**Risk Level: MODERATE-HIGH**

> "Vendor shall not photograph, record, video, livestream, or otherwise capture or reproduce any image, audio, or other media at or relating to the Company"

**Concern:** This could prohibit documenting deliverables, taking screenshots for presentations, or normal project documentation activities.

---

### 3. Two-Year Non-Solicitation of Clients (Section 3)

**Risk Level: HIGH**

- Restricts soliciting ANY clients you had "Material Contact" with for **2 years** after engagement ends
- Very broad definition of "Material Contact" includes anyone you "dealt or communicated with"

**Concern:** Given the Cho Ventures ecosystem spans real estate, development, wellness retreats, and innovation centers - this could significantly limit future business opportunities.

---

### 4. Two-Year Non-Solicitation of Personnel/Vendors (Section 4)

**Risk Level: MODERATE**

- Cannot solicit or hire ANY employees, contractors, or vendors you had contact with
- Applies even if they approach you independently

---

### 5. Corporate Opportunities Clause (Section 5)

**Risk Level: HIGH**

> "Vendor will promptly advise the Company in writing of any Corporate Opportunity that... relates to the Company's current or reasonably contemplated business"

**Concern:** Given Cho Ventures' broad real estate/development/wellness portfolio, this could require disclosing many of your own business opportunities and obtaining their written consent before pursuing them.

---

### 6. Work Product / IP Assignment (Section 10)

**Risk Level: HIGH**

- ALL work product becomes FOC's "sole and exclusive property"
- Irrevocable assignment of all intellectual property rights
- Includes anything "conceived, developed, created" in connection with engagement

**Concern:** This conflicts with standard consulting terms that state "Consultant retains ownership of all pre-existing methodologies, frameworks, templates, and tools." This NDA would transfer your methodologies to them.

---

### 7. Indemnification (Section 18)

**Risk Level: HIGH**

Vendor must indemnify, defend, and hold harmless against:
- ALL losses, costs, damages, claims, liabilities, expenses
- Including attorney's fees
- For "any act or omission by Vendor"

**Concern:** One-sided indemnification with no cap. Standard consulting agreements limit liability to fees paid.

---

### 8. No Attorney-Client Privilege (Section 11)

**Risk Level: LOW-MODERATE**

Explicit acknowledgment that their attorney is NOT your attorney.

---

## Direct Conflicts with Standard Consulting Terms

| Issue | Standard Consulting Terms | Their NDA |
|-------|---------------------------|-----------|
| IP Ownership | Consultant retains methodologies | They own ALL work product |
| Liability Cap | Limited to fees paid | Unlimited indemnification |
| Confidentiality | 2 years mutual | Indefinite, one-sided |
| Non-Solicitation | None | 2 years restriction |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Do NOT sign as-is.** This NDA is significantly more restrictive than typical consulting agreements and conflicts with standard proposal terms.

2. **Request Modifications:**
   - Narrow the definition of "Private Information" to actual confidential business information
   - Remove healthcare/HIPAA references (irrelevant to this engagement)
   - Reduce non-solicitation period to 12 months
   - Remove or narrow the Corporate Opportunities clause
   - Carve out pre-existing IP and methodologies from Work Product
   - Add a liability cap
   - Make confidentiality obligations mutual

3. **Alternative:** Propose using standard mutual confidentiality provisions which are mutual, reasonable, and time-limited.

4. **Red Flag:** This appears to be a template designed for facility vendors (cleaners, maintenance, healthcare workers) rather than strategic consultants. The HIPAA references and "patients/residents" language suggest this was not drafted for this engagement type.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Send clarification request to Cho Ventures
- [ ] Await response on template fit and flexibility
