THIS CONFIDENTIALITY, NON-SOLICITATION, AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into effective on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (the "Effective Date"), by and between **FOC Fund Manager QOZB, LLC** (“the Company”), and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (the “Vendor”). The Company and the Vendor may be referred to in this Agreement individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties." 

The Parties agree as follows: 

1\. Acknowledgement of Private Information. Vendor acknowledges that during Vendor’s engagement with, and/or presence at, The Company, Vendor will be exposed to secret, confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret items that constitute the Company’s private information ("Private Information"), including, without limitation: photographs; patients’, residents’, and visitors’ medical histories and medical conditions; personal financial information of the Company and its residents, patients, and visitors; the Company residents’, patients’, and visitors’ relationships and interpersonal dynamics, passwords, and other matters related to the Company’s residents, patients, and visitors and projects. Vendor expressly acknowledges that if Private Information should become known by any individuals outside the Company, such knowledge would result in substantial hardship, loss, damage, and injury to the Company, its residents, patients, and visitors. For purposes of this Agreement, Private Information includes, but is not limited to, all information not generally known to the public, in spoken, printed, electronic or any other form or medium, relating directly or indirectly to: any business, personal, financial, family, tax or other information relating to the Company or any other invitee or Vendor of the Company; the names and identities of any invitee or Vendor of the Company; the personal habits or tastes of the Company or any invitee or Vendor of the Company; the fact that any person is, was, or may be a resident, patient, client, customer, guest, invitee, visitor, contractor, or vendor of the Company; any pictures, recordings, images, writings or similar items of media, in each case, with respect to or pertaining to the Company or any invitee or Vendor of the Company. Vendor understands that the foregoing list is not exhaustive, and that Private Information also includes other information that is marked or otherwise identified as confidential or proprietary, or that would otherwise appear to a reasonable person to be confidential or proprietary in the context and circumstances in which the information is known or used. Vendor understands and agrees that Private Information developed by Vendor in the course of engagement with the Company shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as if the Company furnished the same Private Information to Vendor in the first instance. Private Information shall not include information that is generally available to and known by the public, provided that such disclosure to the public is through no direct or indirect fault of Vendor or person(s) acting on Vendor’s behalf. Vendor further acknowledges and agrees that it shall not photograph, record, video, livestream, or otherwise capture or reproduce any image, audio, or other media at or relating to the Company, its premises, or any resident, patient, guest, invitee, visitor, contractor, or vendor, without the Company’s prior written consent in each instance. Vendor shall comply with all applicable privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations (including HIPAA to the extent applicable), and, if requested by the Company, shall promptly execute any separate business associate agreement or similar compliance agreement required by the Company. 

2\. Nondisclosure of Private Information & Confidentiality.

1 

4908-0218-9189, v. 1  
solely to those persons or entities to whom such disclosure is expressly permitted by this Agreement. Prohibited disclosures include, without limitation, acknowledging or publicizing the identity of visitors and Vendors of the Company on any electronic or web-based social media sites or releasing any proprietary company information. Without limiting the foregoing, Vendor shall not disclose Private Information to any employee, agent, representative, subcontractor, or affiliate of Vendor without the Company’s prior written consent, and Vendor shall be fully responsible for any act or omission by any person who obtains access to Private Information directly or indirectly through Vendor. Nothing herein is intended, nor shall it, grant Vendor any ownership rights to Private Information and, to the extent that Vendor actually owns any right, title and/or interest in or to such Private Information, then Vendor hereby irrevocably assigns and conveys such rights to the Company without the need for further remuneration from the Company to Vendor. Under no circumstances shall Vendor permit any disclosure of such Private Information to any person or entity to which disclosure is not permitted by this Agreement. Vendor agrees to maintain the Private Information in the strictest trust and confidence. Vendor further agrees not to retain any written, print, or electronic Private Information. Vendor further agrees as follows: 

a) **Permitted Use Only.** Vendor shall use Private Information solely as necessary to perform services for the Company (if any), strictly for the benefit of the Company, and for no other purpose. 

b) **Compelled Disclosure.** If Vendor is required by law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or other legal process to disclose any Private Information, Vendor shall (i) provide the Company prompt written notice (unless prohibited by law), (ii) reasonably cooperate with the Company (at the Company’s expense) in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy, and (iii) disclose only the minimum Private Information legally required. 

c) **Return and Destruction.** Upon the Company’s request at any time, and in any event immediately upon termination or expiration of Vendor’s engagement with the Company, Vendor shall promptly return to the Company all Private Information and all materials containing or reflecting Private Information, in any form, and shall permanently delete all electronic copies (including from backups and personal devices) to the extent within Vendor’s possession or control.

“**Competitor**” means any person, company, or entity engaged in the same or similar business as the Company. 

5\. Corporate Opportunities. 

Vendor acknowledges that during the course of Vendor’s engagement by the Company, Vendor may be offered or become aware of business or investment opportunities in which the Company may or might have an interest where the Company does or may do business (a “**Corporate Opportunity**”), and Vendor will promptly advise the Company in writing of any Corporate Opportunity that (i) relates to the Company’s current or reasonably contemplated business and (ii) becomes known to Vendor through or in connection with Vendor’s engagement with the Company. Accordingly, Vendor agrees that Vendor will disclose to the Company any such Corporate Opportunity offered to Vendor, and Vendor shall not pursue or participate in any such Corporate Opportunity without first obtaining the Company’s express, written consent. 

6\. Non-Disparagement.

4908-0218-9189, v. 1

Additionally, social media use must comply with any social media policy implemented by the Company as well as any other policy or agreement that addresses social media use. 

8\. Company’s Remedies. 

a. Vendor agrees that all obligations imposed upon Vendor by this Agreement shall survive the termination of Vendor’s engagement with the Company. If Vendor breaches or threatens to breach any term or provision contained in this Agreement, Vendor agrees the Company will be entitled to seek and obtain temporary and/or permanent injunctive relief to enjoin Vendor from violating the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The right of the Company to obtain such relief will not be construed to prevent the Company from pursuing, either conjunctively or concurrently, any other legal or equitable remedies. Vendor further agrees that (i) the Company shall not be required to post any bond as a condition to obtaining injunctive relief, and (ii) any Restricted Period shall be equitably extended by the length of time during which Vendor is in breach, to the extent permitted by applicable law. 

b. Enforcement of Covenants; Dispute Resolution. 

Vendor hereby acknowledges that the type and periods of restrictions imposed within this Agreement are fair and reasonable and are reasonably required for the protection of the Company’s Private Information, legitimate business interests, and the goodwill associated with its business. Vendor further acknowledges and agrees that any breach of these covenants will result in irreparable and continuing harm to the Company, for which monetary damages alone may not provide adequate relief. 

Accordingly, in the event of any Vendor breach or anticipatory breach of this Agreement, the Company and Vendor agree that the Company shall be entitled to the following particular forms of relief as a result of such breach, in addition to any monetary remedies otherwise available to it at law or equity: (a) injunctions, both preliminary and permanent, enjoining or restraining such breach or anticipatory breach, and Vendor hereby consents to the issuance thereof forthwith and without bond by any court of competent jurisdiction; and (b) recovery of all reasonable sums and costs, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the Company to enforce the provisions of this Agreement. 

Except as otherwise provided herein, Vendor and the Company agree to resolve all disputes arising from or relating to Vendor’s engagement and any other alleged breach or threatened breach of this Agreement pursuant to the parties’ Mutual Agreement to Mediate & Arbitrate and Vendor hereby consents and submits to Vendor’s Mutual Agreement to Mediate & Arbitrate to the extent applicable. 

Vendor further agrees and acknowledges that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the Company from pursuing any remedies available to it for breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, including the recovery of monetary damages. 

9\. At Will Engagement. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create any contract relating to the term of Vendor’s engagement with the Company. If the relationship between Vendor and the Company is specified by a separate agreement, the terms of that agreement shall control the term of Vendor’s engagement. If no other written agreement specifies the term of Vendor’s engagement, it shall be deemed "at will." Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create an employer-employee 

4 

4908-0218-9189, v. 1  
relationship, partnership, joint venture, or fiduciary relationship between the Company and Vendor, and Vendor has no authority to bind the Company. 

10\. Work Product; Intellectual Property. 

(a) **Work Product.** “Work Product” means any and all inventions, discoveries, developments, methods, processes, designs, works of authorship, documentation, materials, concepts, improvements, data, know-how, and other work product that Vendor, alone or with others, conceives, develops, creates, authors, reduces to practice, or delivers in connection with Vendor’s engagement with the Company, whether or not patentable or copyrightable. 

(b) **Ownership; Assignment.** All Work Product shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. To the extent any Work Product does not automatically vest in the Company, Vendor hereby irrevocably assigns and conveys to the Company all right, title, and interest worldwide in and to the Work Product, including all intellectual property rights therein, without further consideration. 

(c) **Work Made for Hire.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, all Work Product that constitutes a work of authorship shall be deemed a “work made for hire” for the Company. 

(d) **Further Assurances.** Vendor shall execute and deliver any documents and take any further actions reasonably requested by the Company to confirm, evidence, or perfect the Company’s rights in the Work Product. 

11\. Mutual Preparation. Each party has read the foregoing Agreement, fully understands the contents herein, has been or has had the opportunity to be independently advised as to its legal effect, and is under no duress or pressure of any sort to execute it. This Agreement reflects the mutual understanding of the parties with respect to all subject matter addressed herein and shall be construed accordingly. Vendor acknowledges and agrees that (a) any attorney preparing or revising this Agreement has done so solely as counsel for the Company, (b) no attorney-client relationship exists between the Company’s counsel and Vendor by virtue of this Agreement or its negotiation, and (c) Vendor has been advised to seek independent legal counsel of Vendor’s choosing before signing and has either done so or voluntarily elected not to do so. 

12\. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. 

13\. Waiver. Any waiver by any party, expressed or implied, of a default or breach of any term of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other default or breach. Failure of a party to declare or act upon any default will not constitute a waiver of such default. 

14\. Attorneys' Fees. If Vendor breaches, or threatens to breach, this Agreement and the Company employs an attorney as a result of such breach, or threatened breach, Vendor agrees to pay to the Company all such reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and expenses as the Company may incur. 

15\. Assignment. This Agreement is assignable by the Company (without Vendor’s consent) to any affiliate, successor, or assignee of the Company, including in connection with any reorganization, merger, sale of assets, or sale of equity interests, and Vendor may not assign or delegate this Agreement or any obligations hereunder. 

16\. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the complete and exclusive agreement of the Company and Vendor concerning Private Information, and Solicitation, and all discussions, agreements, and statements related thereto are merged into this Agreement. This Agreement may not be changed 

5 

4908-0218-9189, v. 1  
orally, but except where expressly provided herein, this Agreement may be changed only in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any waiver, change, modification, extension, or discharge is sought. The recitals set forth above are true, correct, and contractual in nature and are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by this reference. 

17\. Severability; Reformation. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any invalid or unenforceable provision shall be reformed and enforced to the maximum extent permitted so as to effect the parties’ intent and to provide the Company with the broadest enforceable protection. 

18\. Indemnification. Vendor shall indemnify, defend (with counsel acceptable to the Company), and hold the Company harmless from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, claims, liabilities, or expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, in any way arising from or related to the failure of Vendor to observe or perform any obligation under this Agreement or any act or omission by Vendor (or any person who obtains access to Private Information directly or indirectly through Vendor), including any violation of applicable privacy or confidentiality laws or regulations. 

19\. Vendor’s Acknowledgment of Consideration. Vendor hereby represents, warrants, and covenants that in connection with Vendor’s obligations set forth herein, Vendor has received, is receiving, and/or will be receiving adequate consideration therefor.
