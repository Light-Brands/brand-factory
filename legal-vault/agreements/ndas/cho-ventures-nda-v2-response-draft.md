**Subject: Re: NDA Redlines - Cho Ventures Partnership**

Hi [Name],

Thank you for the thoughtful response and for sending over the corrected NDA - really appreciate the transparency about the template mix-up. The Cho Ventures version is much cleaner and makes sense for this engagement.

I've put together the redlines you requested below. Happy to jump on a call if it's easier to talk through any of these.

## Proposed Redlines

### Section 5 - Corporate Opportunities

Per your note about narrowing the scope to current/active initiatives, here's proposed language:

**Current:**
> "...any Corporate Opportunity that (i) relates to the Company's current or **reasonably contemplated** business..."

**Proposed:**
> "...any Corporate Opportunity that (i) relates to the Company's **currently conducted business or business the Company is actively pursuing as of the Effective Date, which is specifically identified to Vendor in writing**..."

This keeps the spirit of your provision while giving us both clarity on what falls within scope.

### Section 10 - Background IP

Here's standard Background IP language to add as a new subsection 10(e):

> **(e) Background IP.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vendor retains all right, title, and interest in and to any inventions, methodologies, frameworks, templates, tools, processes, or other intellectual property that (i) existed prior to the Effective Date, (ii) were developed by Vendor outside the scope of this engagement, or (iii) are of general applicability and not specific to the Company's business ("Background IP"). To the extent any Work Product incorporates or is derived from Background IP, the Company is granted a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license to use such Background IP solely as embodied in the Work Product delivered under this engagement. For clarity, Vendor's pre-existing methodologies, frameworks, and consulting tools shall remain the sole property of Vendor.

This ensures Cho Ventures owns the engagement-specific deliverables (which is appropriate) while preserving our general-purpose tools and methodologies.

### Sections 3-4 - Non-Solicitation

Based on your openness to refinement, here are three changes:

**1. Shorten Restricted Period (both sections)**

Replace "two years" → "twelve (12) months"

**2. Section 3 - Client Non-Solicitation (narrow scope)**

Replace:
> "...with whom the Vendor had Material Contact during the Vendor's engagement with the Company..."

With:
> "...to whom Vendor was first introduced by the Company during the engagement or with whom Vendor directly worked on Company matters..."

**3. Section 4 - Vendor/Personnel Non-Solicitation (narrow scope)**

Replace:
> "...any other independent contractor, vendor, employee, executive, and/or officer of the Company with whom the Vendor had Material Contact..."

With:
> "...any employee or contractor of the Company with whom Vendor directly collaborated on Company matters..."

---

### One Additional Item - Indemnification (Section 18)

This wasn't part of our original exchange, but wanted to flag: the current indemnification is one-sided with no cap. Would you be open to one of these modifications?

**Option A:** Limit indemnification to direct damages arising from Vendor's gross negligence or willful misconduct

**Option B:** Cap indemnification at the total fees paid under the engagement

This is pretty standard for consulting agreements and protects both sides from disproportionate exposure.

## Summary of Requested Changes

| Section | Change |
|---------|--------|
| §5 Corporate Opportunities | Narrow to "currently conducted or actively pursuing + identified in writing" |
| §10 Work Product | Add Background IP carve-out (subsection e) |
| §3-4 Non-Solicitation | Shorten to 12 months + narrow to direct introductions/collaboration |
| §18 Indemnification | Add limitation (gross negligence/willful misconduct OR fee cap) |

Let me know if you'd prefer I send these as a Word doc with track changes, or if this format works for your team to incorporate.

Looking forward to getting this buttoned up.

Best,
Dan

## Internal Notes

**Tone:** Collaborative, specific, professional
**Goal:** Get clean language locked in while maintaining goodwill
**Concessions we accepted:**
- Section 1 (Private Information) - broad but appropriate
- Section 6 (Non-Disparagement) - standard
- Section 7 (Social Media) - standard
- Florida governing law - acceptable

**New ask:** Indemnification cap (worth raising given their flexibility on other points)

**If they push back:**
- Non-solicitation: Could accept 18 months as compromise
- Indemnification: Could accept "direct damages" limitation without fee cap
- Background IP: This one is non-negotiable - standard for consulting
