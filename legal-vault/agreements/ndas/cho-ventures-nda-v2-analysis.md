# Cho Ventures NDA v2 Analysis & Response

**Review Date:** January 2026
**Document:** Revised Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Disclosure Agreement
**Issuing Party:** Cho Ventures, LP (corrected from FOC Fund Manager QOZB, LLC)
**Status:** Comparison with original + proposed redlines

---

## Summary of Their Response

Cho Ventures acknowledged the original NDA was from the wrong company (likely a healthcare/residential property in their portfolio). Key concessions offered:

| Issue | Their Position |
|-------|----------------|
| Wrong template | Acknowledged; sent corrected Cho Ventures LP NDA |
| Work Product/IP (§10) | Open to "Background IP" carve-out |
| Corporate Opportunities (§5) | Will narrow to "currently conducting or actively pursuing" |
| Non-Solicitation (§3-4) | Open to narrowing scope + shortening to 12 months |

**Overall Assessment:** This is a collaborative and reasonable response. They're showing flexibility on all major points we raised.

## Comparison: Original NDA vs. New NDA

### What Changed (Improvements)

| Issue | Original NDA | New NDA |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Issuing Party | FOC Fund Manager QOZB, LLC | Cho Ventures, LP |
| HIPAA/Medical References | Yes - "medical histories," "HIPAA" | **Removed** |
| "Patients" Language | Yes | **Removed** |

### What Stayed the Same (Still Needs Work)

| Section | Issue | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| §1 Private Information | Still very broad; "residents, guests, invitees" language remains | Minor concern - fits real estate context |
| §3-4 Non-Solicitation | Still 2 years, broad "Material Contact" | **Needs redline** |
| §5 Corporate Opportunities | Still "reasonably contemplated business" | **Needs redline** |
| §10 Work Product/IP | Still assigns ALL work product, no Background IP carve-out | **Needs redline** |
| §18 Indemnification | Still one-sided, unlimited | Worth raising |

## Detailed Analysis of Remaining Concerns

### 1. Section 1 - Private Information Definition

**Current State:** The "residents, guests, invitees, visitors" language remains, but this makes more sense for Cho Ventures' real estate/development context than the original healthcare template.

**Recommendation:** Acceptable as-is. The definition is broad but appropriate for a company that manages properties and projects.

---

### 2. Section 5 - Corporate Opportunities

**Current Language:**
> "Vendor will promptly advise the Company in writing of any Corporate Opportunity that (i) relates to the Company's current or reasonably contemplated business and (ii) becomes known to Vendor through or in connection with Vendor's engagement with the Company."

**Concern:** "Reasonably contemplated business" is still vague. Even with their verbal assurance of narrow interpretation, this should be tightened in writing.

**Their Offer:** They're open to "currently conducting or actively pursuing" language.

**Recommended Redline:** See proposed language below.

---

### 3. Section 10 - Work Product & IP

**Current Language:**
> "All Work Product shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. To the extent any Work Product does not automatically vest in the Company, Vendor hereby irrevocably assigns and conveys to the Company all right, title, and interest..."

**Concern:** No Background IP carve-out. This would transfer ownership of pre-existing methodologies, frameworks, and tools.

**Their Offer:** Comfortable adding "standard Background IP carve-out."

**Recommended Redline:** See proposed language below.

---

### 4. Sections 3-4 - Non-Solicitation

**Current Terms:**
- 2-year "Restricted Period"
- Broad "Material Contact" definition
- Covers clients, vendors, and personnel

**Their Offer:** Open to:
- Narrowing to clients/vendors "directly interacted with" or "introduced to by Cho Ventures"
- Shortening term (suggested 12 months)

**Recommended Parameters:** See proposed language below.

---

### 5. Section 18 - Indemnification (New Flag)

**Current Language:**
> "Vendor shall indemnify, defend... and hold the Company harmless from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, claims, liabilities, or expenses..."

**Concern:** One-sided indemnification with no cap. Standard consulting agreements typically:
- Cap liability at fees paid
- Make indemnification mutual

**Recommendation:** Raise this point even though they didn't address it. Propose limiting indemnification to direct damages caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct.

---

## Proposed Redlines

### Section 5 - Corporate Opportunities (Proposed)

**Replace:**
> "relates to the Company's current or reasonably contemplated business"

**With:**
> "relates to the Company's currently conducted business or business the Company is actively pursuing as of the Effective Date, which is specifically identified to Vendor in writing"

**Rationale:** This achieves their stated intent while providing clarity and limiting scope to known initiatives.

---

### Section 10 - Background IP Carve-Out (Proposed Addition)

**Add new subsection 10(e):**

> **(e) Background IP.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vendor retains all right, title, and interest in and to any inventions, methodologies, frameworks, templates, tools, processes, or other intellectual property that (i) existed prior to the Effective Date, (ii) were developed by Vendor outside the scope of this engagement, or (iii) are of general applicability and not specific to the Company's business ("Background IP"). To the extent any Work Product incorporates or is derived from Background IP, the Company is granted a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license to use such Background IP solely as embodied in the Work Product delivered under this engagement. For clarity, Vendor's pre-existing methodologies, frameworks, and consulting tools shall remain the sole property of Vendor.

---

### Sections 3-4 - Non-Solicitation (Proposed Modifications)

**1. Shorten Restricted Period:**

**Replace:**
> "for two years following the termination"

**With:**
> "for twelve (12) months following the termination"

**2. Narrow Scope (Section 3):**

**Replace:**
> "with whom the Vendor had Material Contact during the Vendor's engagement"

**With:**
> "to whom Vendor was first introduced by the Company during the engagement or with whom Vendor directly worked on Company matters"

**3. Narrow Scope (Section 4):**

**Replace:**
> "any other independent contractor, vendor, employee, executive, and/or officer of the Company with whom the Vendor had Material Contact"

**With:**
> "any employee or contractor of the Company with whom Vendor directly collaborated on Company matters"

---

## Response Approach

Their response was collaborative and professional. Recommended approach:

1. **Express appreciation** for their flexibility and the corrected NDA
2. **Propose specific redlines** as requested
3. **Add indemnification** as a new point (reasonable to raise)
4. **Keep tone collaborative** - they've been accommodating

---

## Items NOT to Push On

The following items are acceptable or not worth negotiating:
- Section 1 (Private Information) - appropriate for context
- Section 6 (Non-Disparagement) - standard
- Section 7 (Social Media) - standard
- Section 11 (Mutual Preparation) - standard
- Section 12 (Florida law) - acceptable
- Section 8 (Remedies) - standard for NDAs
