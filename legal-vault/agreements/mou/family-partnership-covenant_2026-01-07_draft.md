# Family Partnership Covenant

> *A Sacred Agreement of Mutual Trust and Shared Vision*

---

**Effective Date:** _________________, 2026

**This Covenant** is entered into freely and with full hearts by the following families, who come together not merely as business partners, but as a united circle of trust, bound by shared values and a common vision for what we will build together.

---

## The Founding Families

### The Lawless Family
**Daniel Lawless** and **Jennifer Lawless**

### The Courchesne Family
**Nicholas Courchesne** and **Nancy Courchesne**

### The Demou Brothers
**Andreas Demou** and **Mike Demou**

---

## Preamble

We, the undersigned families, enter into this covenant recognizing that the foundation of any great endeavor is trust. Before contracts are signed, before business structures are formalized, before capital is committed—there must first be alignment of hearts and minds.

This document represents our mutual commitment to one another. It is a declaration that we choose to walk this path together, to share equally in both the work and the rewards, and to make decisions as families united by a common purpose.

We believe that businesses built on genuine trust, transparent communication, and mutual respect create lasting value—not just for the partners, but for everyone they touch.

---

## Article I: Foundation of Equality

### Equal Ownership
Each family shall hold an equal **one-third (1/3) ownership interest** in the entity formed under this covenant.

This equal division reflects our belief that each family brings irreplaceable value to our partnership. We do not measure contribution by hours logged or dollars invested alone, but by the full presence, wisdom, and commitment each family brings to our shared table.

### Equal Voice
Each family shall have **one vote** in all matters requiring family consensus. No family's voice carries more weight than another's. We are equals in every sense.

---

## Article II: Business Structure & Focus Areas

### The Light Brands Collective

Our partnership shall operate under the umbrella of **Light Brands**—a collective of families united in purpose. The business entity formed under this covenant shall serve as both an operating company and a vehicle through which we enter future partnerships and ventures.

### Three Pillars of Focus

Our collective shall concentrate its efforts across three distinct but interconnected service lines:

#### 1. Consulting Services (Low Friction Entry)
**Revenue Range:** $1,000 – $15,000 per engagement

Strategic AI consulting services designed as accessible entry points for organizations seeking transformation. These engagements:
- Provide AI strategy and readiness assessments
- Offer low-friction, high-value advisory services
- Prepare clients for deeper implementation work
- Serve as the relationship-building foundation of our practice

#### 2. Implementation Services (Stewardship Council Projects)
**Revenue Range:** $20,000 – $250,000 per project

Light-aligned implementation projects delivered through our Stewardship Council model:
- Full-service AI and technology implementation
- Projects selected through collective discernment
- Emphasis on alignment with our values and vision
- Deeper partnerships with clients who share our philosophy

#### 3. Light Brands Owned SaaS Products
**Ownership:** 100% collectively owned

Micro-SaaS brands built on the principle of **minimal code, maximum value**:
- Fully autonomous delivery systems
- Focused, single-purpose applications
- Built to serve without constant attention
- Revenue-generating assets owned entirely by our collective

### Future Partnerships

The business formed under this covenant may be brought into additional partnerships and ventures as opportunities arise. Any such arrangements shall be subject to the decision-making processes outlined in this document.

## Article III: Financial Structure

### Distribution Waterfall

All revenue generated by the collective shall be distributed according to the following priority:

#### Priority 1: Operating Expenses
All legitimate operating expenses of the business shall be paid first, including but not limited to:
- Software and infrastructure costs
- Professional services (legal, accounting)
- Marketing and business development
- Insurance and compliance
- Any other costs necessary to operate the business

#### Priority 2: Reserve Fund (30%)
After operating expenses are satisfied, **thirty percent (30%)** of remaining revenue shall be allocated to reserve funds:
- **10% to each family's individual reserve account**
- Each family maintains autonomous control over their reserve portion
- Families may direct their reserve funds according to their own judgment and values
- No family may dictate how another family utilizes their reserve

#### Priority 3: Profit Distribution (70%)
The remaining **seventy percent (70%)** after operating expenses and reserves shall be distributed equally:
- **One-third (1/3) to each family**
- Distributions to occur on a schedule determined by the partnership
- All distributions subject to maintaining adequate operating capital

### Reserve Fund Autonomy

Each partner family shall have complete discretion over their portion of the reserve fund. This may include but is not limited to:
- Reinvestment into the collective
- Personal family investments
- Charitable giving
- Emergency savings
- Any use the family deems appropriate

This autonomy reflects our trust in each other's judgment and our recognition that each family has unique circumstances and priorities.

## Article IV: Term & Annual Re-Agreement

### Initial Term

The financial terms and business structure outlined in this covenant (Articles II and III) shall govern our partnership for an initial term of **one (1) year** from the Effective Date.

### Philosophy of Flexible Evolution

We recognize that:
- Businesses evolve, and our agreements should evolve with them
- What works in year one may need adjustment in year two
- Flexibility is a strength, not a weakness
- Regular reassessment keeps our partnership healthy and aligned

### Annual Re-Agreement Process

At the conclusion of each one-year term, the families shall:

1. **Review the Year**
   - Assess what worked well and what could improve
   - Review financial performance across all three focus areas
   - Evaluate whether the current structure serves our collective goals

2. **Discuss Proposed Changes**
   - Any family may propose modifications to financial terms
   - All proposals shall be considered with open minds
   - Discussions shall honor our commitment to good faith deliberation

3. **Renew or Revise**
   - By mutual consent, renew the existing terms for another year
   - Or, by mutual consent, adopt revised terms that better serve our evolving needs
   - The foundational principles of equality and trust (Article I) remain constant

### Continuity Between Terms

Should the annual re-agreement process extend beyond the term expiration, the existing terms shall remain in effect until new terms are agreed upon or the partnership concludes through proper process.

---

## Article V: Decision Making

### The Principle of Supermajority
Major decisions affecting our shared venture shall be made by a **supermajority vote of two-thirds (2/3)**, meaning at least two of the three families must agree to move forward.

This structure ensures that:
- No single family can unilaterally direct the course of our partnership
- No single family can indefinitely block progress
- Decisions carry the weight of genuine consensus

### What Constitutes a Major Decision
Major decisions include, but are not limited to:
- Formation, restructuring, or dissolution of business entities
- Significant financial commitments or investments
- Addition of new partners or ownership changes
- Strategic direction and major pivots
- Distribution of profits or capital calls
- Hiring or removal of key leadership
- Any matter a family brings forward as requiring formal vote

### Good Faith Deliberation
Before any vote, we commit to:
- Sharing our perspectives openly and honestly
- Listening with genuine intent to understand
- Seeking solutions that honor all concerns
- Giving adequate time for reflection when needed
- Never rushing decisions that deserve careful thought

## Article VI: Our Commitments to One Another

### Transparency
We will share information openly and proactively. There shall be no hidden agendas, no withheld concerns, no surprises that could have been shared. When in doubt, we communicate.

### Honesty
We will speak truth to one another, even when it is difficult. We trust that honest feedback, delivered with care, strengthens rather than weakens our bond.

### Respect
We will honor each family's unique strengths, perspectives, and circumstances. We recognize that each family may have different capacities at different times, and we extend grace accordingly.

### Loyalty
We are committed to one another's success. When one family faces challenges, the others step forward. We win together or we learn together—there is no other way.

### Long-Term Thinking
We build for generations, not quarters. We will resist short-term pressures that compromise our values or our relationships.

---

## Article VII: Communication

### Regular Connection
We commit to maintaining regular communication, including:
- Scheduled family partnership meetings (frequency to be determined together)
- Informal check-ins as relationships naturally allow
- Prompt communication when time-sensitive matters arise

### Addressing Concerns
When concerns arise, we agree to:
1. Raise them directly with the relevant parties first
2. Assume positive intent until proven otherwise
3. Seek to understand before seeking to be understood
4. Involve all families when matters affect the whole partnership

### Conflict Resolution
Should disagreements arise that we cannot resolve among ourselves, we commit to:
1. First, taking time for reflection and cooling of emotions
2. Second, engaging in facilitated dialogue if needed
3. Third, seeking mediation before any formal dispute process
4. Always, remembering that our relationship transcends any single disagreement

---

## Article VIII: This Covenant's Relationship to Future Agreements

### A Foundation, Not a Ceiling
This covenant establishes the spirit and principles that shall guide our partnership. Future legal documents—operating agreements, bylaws, contracts—shall be built upon this foundation and shall not contradict its essential principles.

### When Documents Conflict
Should any future agreement conflict with the principles stated herein, this covenant shall serve as the interpretive guide for understanding our original intent.

### Living Document
This covenant may be amended by unanimous consent of all three families. We acknowledge that circumstances change and wisdom grows, and we remain open to evolving our agreements as we learn together.

---

## Article IX: Acknowledgment

By signing below, each family affirms:

- We enter this covenant freely, without coercion or reservation
- We have read and understood all provisions herein
- We commit to uphold both the letter and spirit of this agreement
- We look forward to building something meaningful together
