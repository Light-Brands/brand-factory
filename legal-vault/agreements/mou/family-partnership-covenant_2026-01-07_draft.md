> *A Sacred Agreement of Mutual Trust and Shared Vision*

---

**Effective Date:** _________________, 2026

**This Covenant** is entered into freely and with full hearts by the following families, who come together not merely as business partners, but as a united circle of trust, bound by shared values and a common vision for what we will build together.

---

## The Founding Families

### The Lawless Family
**Daniel Lawless** and **Jennifer Lawless**

### The Courchesne Family
**Nicholas Courchesne** and **Nancy Courchesne**

### The Demou Brothers
**Andreas Demou** and **Mike Demou**

## Preamble

We, the undersigned families, enter into this covenant recognizing that the foundation of any great endeavor is trust. Before contracts are signed, before business structures are formalized, before capital is committed—there must first be alignment of hearts and minds.

This document represents our mutual commitment to one another. It is a declaration that we choose to walk this path together, to share equally in both the work and the rewards, and to make decisions as families united by a common purpose.

We believe that businesses built on genuine trust, transparent communication, and mutual respect create lasting value—not just for the partners, but for everyone they touch.

---

## Article I: Foundation of Equality

### Equal Ownership
Each family shall hold an equal **one-third (1/3) ownership interest** in any business entity formed under this covenant.

This equal division reflects our belief that each family brings irreplaceable value to our partnership. We do not measure contribution by hours logged or dollars invested alone, but by the full presence, wisdom, and commitment each family brings to our shared table.

### Equal Voice
Each family shall have **one vote** in all matters requiring family consensus. No family's voice carries more weight than another's. We are equals in every sense.

---

## Article II: Decision Making

### The Principle of Supermajority
Major decisions affecting our shared venture shall be made by a **supermajority vote of two-thirds (2/3)**, meaning at least two of the three families must agree to move forward.

This structure ensures that:
- No single family can unilaterally direct the course of our partnership
- No single family can indefinitely block progress
- Decisions carry the weight of genuine consensus

### What Constitutes a Major Decision
Major decisions include, but are not limited to:
- Formation, restructuring, or dissolution of business entities
- Significant financial commitments or investments
- Addition of new partners or ownership changes
- Strategic direction and major pivots
- Distribution of profits or capital calls
- Hiring or removal of key leadership
- Any matter a family brings forward as requiring formal vote

### Good Faith Deliberation
Before any vote, we commit to:
- Sharing our perspectives openly and honestly
- Listening with genuine intent to understand
- Seeking solutions that honor all concerns
- Giving adequate time for reflection when needed
- Never rushing decisions that deserve careful thought

## Article III: Our Commitments to One Another

### Transparency
We will share information openly and proactively. There shall be no hidden agendas, no withheld concerns, no surprises that could have been shared. When in doubt, we communicate.

### Honesty
We will speak truth to one another, even when it is difficult. We trust that honest feedback, delivered with care, strengthens rather than weakens our bond.

### Respect
We will honor each family's unique strengths, perspectives, and circumstances. We recognize that each family may have different capacities at different times, and we extend grace accordingly.

### Loyalty
We are committed to one another's success. When one family faces challenges, the others step forward. We win together or we learn together—there is no other way.

### Long-Term Thinking
We build for generations, not quarters. We will resist short-term pressures that compromise our values or our relationships.

---

## Article IV: Communication

### Regular Connection
We commit to maintaining regular communication, including:
- Scheduled family partnership meetings (frequency to be determined together)
- Informal check-ins as relationships naturally allow
- Prompt communication when time-sensitive matters arise

### Addressing Concerns
When concerns arise, we agree to:
1. Raise them directly with the relevant parties first
2. Assume positive intent until proven otherwise
3. Seek to understand before seeking to be understood
4. Involve all families when matters affect the whole partnership

### Conflict Resolution
Should disagreements arise that we cannot resolve among ourselves, we commit to:
1. First, taking time for reflection and cooling of emotions
2. Second, engaging in facilitated dialogue if needed
3. Third, seeking mediation before any formal dispute process
4. Always, remembering that our relationship transcends any single disagreement

---

## Article V: This Covenant's Relationship to Future Agreements

### A Foundation, Not a Ceiling
This covenant establishes the spirit and principles that shall guide our partnership. Future legal documents—operating agreements, bylaws, contracts—shall be built upon this foundation and shall not contradict its essential principles.

### When Documents Conflict
Should any future agreement conflict with the principles stated herein, this covenant shall serve as the interpretive guide for understanding our original intent.

### Living Document
This covenant may be amended by unanimous consent of all three families. We acknowledge that circumstances change and wisdom grows, and we remain open to evolving our agreements as we learn together.

---

## Article VI: Acknowledgment

By signing below, each family affirms:

- We enter this covenant freely, without coercion or reservation
- We have read and understood all provisions herein
- We commit to uphold both the letter and spirit of this agreement
- We look forward to building something meaningful together
