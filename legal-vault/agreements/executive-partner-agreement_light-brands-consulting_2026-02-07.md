## ARTICLE 12 — GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

### 12.1 Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of Delaware, United States of America**, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

Delaware law is selected because:

**(b)** Delaware courts (particularly the Court of Chancery) are recognized internationally for expertise in business disputes;

**(c)** Delaware law is neutral to all parties — none of the Partners reside in Delaware, avoiding the perception of home-court advantage;

**(d)** It provides a seamless foundation for the anticipated future corporate or LLC structure, which is likely to be organized in Delaware;

**(e)** Delaware law is widely recognized and enforceable in both the United States and Canada, supporting the cross-border nature of this partnership.

### 12.3 Consent to Jurisdiction

Each Partner irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the federal courts located therein for any proceedings not subject to arbitration under Article 11.

## ARTICLE 13 — TERM AND TERMINATION
