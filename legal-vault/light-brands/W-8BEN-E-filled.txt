                (calculated as a weighted average of the percentage of passive
                assets measured quarterly).

                              IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

1. FOREIGN TIN: If 15801851 Canada Inc. has been assigned a CRA Business
   Number (BN), use that on Line 9b instead of the corporation number.

2. TREATY BENEFITS: Part III is optional. Complete it only if you want
   reduced withholding on U.S.-source income. For most service payments
   from U.S. clients, the 0% rate under Article VII applies.

3. ACTIVE VS PASSIVE: This form assumes the company earns primarily active
   business income (services, consulting). If the company primarily holds
   investments or earns passive income (interest, dividends, rent), use
   "Passive NFFE" (Part XXVI) instead.

4. VALIDITY: This form is generally valid for 3 years from the date signed,
   or until circumstances change.

5. WHO GETS THIS FORM: Give to U.S. clients/payers who request it. Do NOT
   send to the IRS.
